1
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,332
This is 80. The missing man should
be considered extremely dangerous..

2
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,832
81-20, can you hear me? Come in.

3
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,415
Eight, one, two, zero.
Can you hear me? Come in.

4
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:28,707
News-flash. A policeman was killed
and another was badly injured-

5
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,457
- In a violent assault on County Road 46
at six o'clock in the afternoon.

6
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,249
The perpetrator disappeared in the police car.

7
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:41,332
According to the police there's
not yet a description of the offender-

8
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,249
- But the incident has been linked
with events in Gosseberga-

9
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:50,290
- Where the wanted Lisbeth Salander
was arrested after the shooting incident.

10
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:55,040
She's being treated at Sahlgrenska Hospital
and her condition is critical.

11
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,665
The police are expected to convene
for a press conference later today.

12
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,665
We've removed a bullet from her head.
It's a serious injury.

13
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,665
And she has gunshot wounds
in the left hip and right shoulder.

14
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,332
- Can she make it?
- She's stable now.

15
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,290
Without complications
it should work.

16
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,832
- May I visit her?
- Not now.

17
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,457
I'm a close friend.

18
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,749
You can wait, but I promise nothing.

19
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,915
I'm coming.

20
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,874
- Is Lisbeth Salander innocent?
- I don't know.

21
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:38,332
Read it. He commited serious
legal assaults against Salander.

22
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,915
Everything's documented here.

23
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,832
It's a police report from '93.

24
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,499
It's classified.
Where did you get that?

25
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,415
- Mike Blomkvist from Millennium.
- Where did he get it from?

26
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,332
That you may have to ask him.

27
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,999
Hello.

28
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,665
Can you open your eyes?

29
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,124
My name is Anders Jonasson.
I'm a doctor here.

30
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,207
You're in Sahlgrenska
Hospital in Gothenburg.

31
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,582
Can you count to ten?

32
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,749
One, two, three, four...

33
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,457
That is good.

34
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,540
Thanks. Hello.

35
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,749
- Do we have any names?
- Yes, Holm and Jonasson.

36
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:15,582
- Oh, shit.
- You can see her now. Three minutes.

37
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,082
You have to get through this, Lisbeth.

38
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:21,332
I would like to report a crime.
My daughter tried to murder me.

39
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:26,665
We will get to that, but first
tell us about Ronald Niedermann.

40
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,707
We believe he murdered a police officer
and wounded another in the afternoon.

41
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,665
I don't know what he's doing.

42
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,540
But I do know, however,-

43
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:45,249
- that my daughter tried
to kill me tonight.

44
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,665
Ronald Niedermann is wanted.
Do you know where he could be?

45
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,957
No. But between us ...

46
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,249
I'm getting a little afraid of him.

47
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:04,874
I'm just
an old injured man.

48
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,040
Disabled.

49
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:12,665
- We know who you are.
- We've read your SAPO file.

50
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,249
We want to hear from you
on the three Stockholm murders of-

51
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,207
journalist Dag Svensson
and his girlfriend Mia Bergman.

52
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,874
And the sollicitor Nils Bjurman.

53
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,832
That I know nothing about.
Nothing.

54
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,165
Damn it. Next time we hear from
him, we must be better prepared

55
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:51,332
I'm going to Gosseberga now.
Some colleagues promised to pick me up.

56
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,499
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

57
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,374
- Hi.
- Hi. Have you met Lisbeth Salander?

58
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,457
- They said she was sedated.
- She is.

59
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,832
Have you met Zalachenko?
What did he say?

60
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,499
- What happens now?
- I must speak with the doctors.

61
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,540
Then take the train to Stockholm.

62
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:33,749
You can ride with me. I have a car.
If you want to.

63
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,374
- Dr Jonasson will be here shortly.
- Thanks.

64
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:45,249
I intend to write the story about Lisbeth
and publish it in Millennium.

65
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,749
I intend to write it all.

66
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,999
The Security Service and a psychiatrist
got her locked in a madhouse.

67
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:57,332
- There will be some trouble.
- Yes, that's for sure.

68
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:03,457
Until you see
that Niedermann is involved.

69
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:09,707
Proof of that is pretty thin yet.
And he's not the type to confess.

70
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:17,915
I need someone on the inside
that I can trust.

71
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,874
I need to know what happens
regarding the indictment against Lisbeth.

72
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,707
It sounds like a good way
to get fired.

73
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:50,832
Place her in seven and prepare her,
I'll look at it later.

74
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,499
I was wondering when you would show up.

75
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,707
We've discussed
how we'll help you.

76
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:09,207
But to develop a strategy
we need to hear your version, too.

77
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:17,207
And how should
the strategy look?

78
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,915
We'll find out together.

79
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,249
But it'll probably be hard to
avoid a short prison sentence.

80
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,207
Ah. Is that so?

81
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:32,040
We'll assist with a lawyer
and all that's needed.

82
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:37,749
But you must cooperate
and give us some guarantees.

83
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,957
Niedermann.
Niedermann is the culprit!

84
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,624
It was he who shot Lisbeth.

85
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,540
There are currently serious allegations against you.
It'll be hard to get around them.

86
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,582
That's your problem.

87
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,207
If you don't solve it-

88
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,415
- I'll contact the media.

89
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,374
I have names,
dates, events ... everything.

90
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,457
I can crush you, completely.

91
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,374
I'm a survivor.
You ought to know that by now.

92
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,790
- Zalachenko, you don't understand ...
- It's you who doesn't understand!

93
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,040
This conversation is over.

94
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,249
News-flash.
After the Gosseberga police murder-

95
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,499
- the search for
the offender has intensified.

96
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:41,374
The police have identified him as
35-year-old Ronald Niedermann.

97
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:46,707
He's blond, short hair,
205 cm tall, and powerfully built.

98
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:51,499
He's armed and considered
extremely dangerous by the police.

99
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,415
No, no, no!

100
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,749
Hello, Lisbeth.

101
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,832
How are you?

102
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:34,082
Do you remember me?
Anders Jonasson's my name.

103
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,249
It's understandable if you're tired.

104
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,499
You had a bullet wound in the head.

105
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,915
We managed to remove the bullet.

106
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,415
It hasn't damaged any vital parts,
As far as we can see.

107
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,124
You also had gunshot wounds
in the right shoulder and left hip.

108
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,915
But it seems that they will heal fine.

109
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,540
Can it give me brain damage?

110
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,999
That's complex and sometimes difficult to see,
but you shouldn't worry.

111
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,957
The police wanted to talk to you.

112
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,249
But I said no,
because of your condition.

113
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:23,415
I'm sure they'll return,
but I won't let them come yet.

114
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,374
How is Zalachenko?

115
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,624
You mean Karl Axel Bodin?
He's down the corridor.

116
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:41,415
Severly beaten, but he's patched
and his condition is stable.

117
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,165
Damn.

118
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,124
My Text is between 40 and 50 pages.

119
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,415
I want to have parts of the Björck
investigation by fax.

120
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,124
To make it stronger, better looking.

121
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,790
- What kind of photos do we have?
- Not much.

122
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,790
We can get pictures of Gunnar Björck,
Teleborian and Zalachenko.

123
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:15,124
- Some people from St. Stephen's Hospital.
- Yes, and Lisbeth.

124
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,415
- It sounds like at least 75 pages.
- There may be more. It'll be good.

125
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,790
- Can we get more names?
- No, we must focus on what we have.

126
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,082
We can hope that the publication
will shed some light on this.

127
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,665
That one thing leads to another, and so on.

128
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,790
Now let's get to work.

129
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,457
How are you, anyway?
You look quite worn out.

130
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:04,290
- I'm completely drained.
- You want to talk?

131
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,665
No, not now. I gotta go home and sleep.

132
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,790
Then I should do it.
Go home and sleep now. Okay?

133
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,832
Her name is Lisbeth Salander.

134
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:41,165
Sweden has come to know her through
press conferences and headlines.

135
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,790
She is 27 years old.
A meter and a half in height.

136
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,874
She's been described as psychopathic,
murderess, and a lesbian satanist.

137
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:58,249
We reveal how government officials
conspired against her-

138
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,790
- To protect a pathologically
deranged killer.

139
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:07,624
Alexander Zalachenko is a renegade
GRU agent from the Soviet Union.

140
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,832
In Sweden, he is guilty
of serious crimes:

141
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,290
Arms trading, drug dealing,
and sex trafficking.

142
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:21,790
Alexander Zalachenko is
Lisbeth Salander's father.

143
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,249
Mr Bodin. Come, let's go back.
This isn't your room.

144
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,957
This way.

145
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,749
Salander struck again.

146
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,332
MURDERER HUNTED THROUGHOUT SWEDEN

147
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,124
- There you go, keep it.
- Thanks.

148
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,582
- I'm looking for Fredrik Clinton.
- Who may I say is calling?

149
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:55,790
- An old colleague of his.
- Father's resting, but come inside.

150
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:02,915
Zalachenko does what's best
for him regardless of consequences.

151
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,332
That's my assessment, too.

152
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:11,124
If he starts talking,
he must have proof.

153
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:17,540
The evidence is only available
in the archive, and he can't get in.

154
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,707
No, he can't.

155
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:26,499
But we can't risk that
he starts talking.

156
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:30,665
We need to silence him
at any cost.

157
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,749
On that we agree.
As usual.

158
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,790
But you can see how I am.

159
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:43,332
Fredrik, we need you.
One last time.

160
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,540
I can't.

161
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,040
I spend five hours-

162
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:53,582
- Every other day at the hospital
on the dialysis machine,

163
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,540
I will die soon.

164
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,415
I can't get a new kidney.

165
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,707
That's it, my friend.

166
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:14,999
- Thanks honey.
- They're freshly baked.

167
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,415
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

168
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,749
No.

169
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,540
We don't know too much
about each other's private lives.

170
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,915
Despite the fact that we've
worked together for...

171
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,582
yes, more than 35 years.

172
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,874
Lisbeth Salander, then?

173
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,707
The indictment's already started.
What do we do with her?

174
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,040
The prosecutor wants Lisbeth arrested
for the attempted murder of Zalachenko.

175
00:23:55,375 --> 00:24:01,040
But the trial will be about equally important
things as the assassination attempt.

176
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,957
What happened in Gosseberga
is the result of a long story.

177
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:09,957
It's about violence, exploitation
of Lisbeth and her mother.

178
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:15,540
Here you have strong evidence
to build your defense on.

179
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,040
- This is classified.
- Don't worry about it.

180
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,874
You got it from a journalist
who didn't say where it came from.

181
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:50,582
THE PRIME MINISTER
DANGER

182
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,165
MURDER

183
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:59,249
OBSERVER

184
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,332
KING OF SWEDEN

185
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,457
Archbishop

186
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,915
PRIME MINISTER

187
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:39,540
SJ's X2000 No. 429 from Stockholm
has arrived on track number 6.

188
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,874
I don't need a lawyer.

189
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,832
You'll be charged with
the attempted murder of your dad.

190
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,790
Micke thinks they'll try to get you
in the mental hospital again-

191
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,124
- So yes, you need a lawyer.

192
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,040
But you can choose another.

193
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:37,665
Unless you want the court to
appoint a public defender.

194
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:45,540
Does your silence mean
I should leave?

195
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:59,207
It's your choice.

196
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,707
Do you have a cigarette?

197
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,249
- Do you have a nicotine patch?
- Yes, one moment.

198
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:14,582
Hi, I'm in Room Three,
Will the stretcher come soon?

199
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:23,332
I got this from Micke.
I think you know what it contains?

200
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:30,290
The two of us need to talk
a lot with each other.

201
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:34,082
So I want you to be completely
honest with me.

202
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:40,374
Micke's told me most of it,
but some things he says that-

203
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,749
- You must decide
if you want to tell.

204
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,624
I assume you know
what he thinks.

205
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,999
There's something about computers
and a DVD.

206
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,124
After everything we've done for you
through the years-

207
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:16,499
- Then you threaten us.
It's quite rude.

208
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:22,165
I'm a survivor.
I do what I must to survive.

209
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,707
No, you do it because you're an evil
and throughly rotten man without honor.

210
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,124
Without morality.

211
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,207
I came here
to give you our answer.

212
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:41,082
We won't help you this time, you bastard.

213
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:45,249
You have no choice.
Do you not understand that?

214
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:50,124
Life has taught me
that there's always a choice.

215
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:55,915
Idiots.

216
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,749
- I'll crush you.
- You won't do anything.

217
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:07,415
No, lay down!
Sorry! I'll go and see what happened.

218
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,040
Out!

219
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,290
He has a gun!

220
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,665
Quick!

221
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,790
Wait, I'm coming.
Hold me tight.

222
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,124
Hold on to me.

223
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,540
No ...

224
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:12,749
We monitor airports and ferry berths
and we should continue to do so.

225
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:17,082
What are the chances that Niedermann's
left the country?

226
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,957
I think he's in Sweden.

227
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:25,332
But he's hunted throughout Europe.
He won't go anywhere.

228
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,832
- No girlfriends?
- He's lived as a hermit.

229
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:34,999
He's only had contact with
Zalachenko, who lied to him.

230
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,582
But he listened to Zalachenko anyway.

231
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,624
You've read the report...

232
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,249
Gunnar Björck's.

233
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,124
I've browsed through it.

234
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:55,707
Maybe he thinks with Zalachenko
he's protected

235
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,415
That's why he didn't say anything.

236
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,415
Yeah, maybe so.

237
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,790
But we must keep him out of this.

238
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,290
To be more precise, we need him.

239
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:15,249
The public prosecutor has withdrawn
the investigation, so it's moot.

240
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,374
What the hell are you saying?

241
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:23,499
Björck's investigation is useless
because it's classified.

242
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,707
Zalachenko was shot.
He's dead.

243
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:32,290
Someone came in Sahlgrenska
and shot him dead.

244
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,082
Why didn't the police
provide better protection?

245
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,665
Completely incomprehensible. You wouldn't
think things like that could happen here.

246
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,707
Going armed into a hospital
and killing a patient is incredible.

247
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:59,290
He pulled the door handle, but couldn't
open it. It was so unreal.

248
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,624
An old man with a gun.

249
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,749
Then I heard the shot,
when he shot himself.

250
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,624
Are you sure he tried
to get to Lisbeth?

251
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,374
Yes, it was awful!
I've never been so scared.

252
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:18,082
- Should I come down to you?
- No.

253
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:25,040
You don't need to come. I'll sleep
with my friend Vera Åkerlund in Kålltorp.

254
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:29,249
- The press conference is at 15:00 at the police station.
- I'll have to run.

255
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,957
- Take care of yourself now.
- Yep.

256
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,999
- We'll talk.
- OK. Bye.

257
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,332
Well... Fredrik?

258
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,874
What in the world...?
Come in, come.

259
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:24,415
We're trying to get information
about it now.

260
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,165
At what time was it?
Find out now.

261
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,457
What the hell?

262
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,832
- You've heard what happened?
- Zalachenko has been shot.

263
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:51,957
It seems Evert Gullberg
shot him.

264
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,707
It's chaos down there.
We haven't had any confirmation.

265
00:33:56,041 --> 00:34:01,082
Then I can confirm it.
It was Evert who shot him.

266
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,374
To complete the plans.

267
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:09,415
- Should I get coffee or something?
- No, not now.

268
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:19,582
What the hell are you talking about?
What plans?

269
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:25,749
Gullberg had only a few months
left to live. He had liver cancer.

270
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:31,332
He chose to make a final,
last effort for us.

271
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,790
He went down with honors.

272
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:41,999
- You knew he would kill him?
- Of course.

273
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:47,665
His mission was
to silence Zalachenko.

274
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,499
And Salander too, that was the plan.

275
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:00,249
Are you equally as
insane as Gullberg?

276
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:06,374
Watch your mouth, Hallberg.
It was the right decision.

277
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:10,624
- We did what was necessary.
- Necessary? Decision?

278
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:15,999
You and Gullberg have no right
to decide anything!

279
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:21,874
Whatever happens, Zalachenko's
death can't be linked to us.

280
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,082
Not Evert Gullberg either.

281
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:34,790
Our task is to
make the decisions-

282
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,040
- That no one else dares to make.

283
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,665
Least of all, politicians.
It's that simple.

284
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,999
And one more thing ...

285
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:53,374
I've come back into service.

286
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,415
I lead the operational activities-

287
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,540
- Until this crisis is over.

288
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:07,457
The man who fired the lethal
shot and then took his own life-

289
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:13,332
- has been identified
as a 78-year-old pensioner.

290
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:18,999
He's worked as an
accountant and a tax lawyer.

291
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:23,332
- What was his name?
- We will not disclose that at this time.

292
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,874
Is there a connection
to Lisbeth Salander?

293
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:31,749
We can certainly reject any possible
connection to Lisbeth Salander.

294
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,999
This was a lonely perpetrator
who acted as he did-

295
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:40,290
- based on his own
paranoid imagination and ideas.

296
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:45,540
He's sent confused messages
to famous politicians and the media-

297
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:50,040
- In which there are death threats
to Karl Axel Bodin.

298
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,249
Why?

299
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:59,332
Security Services are investigating,
but he was probably mentally ill.

300
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:04,457
What does this have to do with
the case against Lisbeth Salander?

301
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,665
Currently nothing.

302
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,665
Karl Axel Bodin had given his testimony-

303
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,582
And we have forensic evidence
against Salander.

304
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:19,457
He tried to enter
Lisbeth Salander's room-

305
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:23,749
- But you don't see any
connection with Salander.

306
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,457
Why would he try
Getting into her room?

307
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:34,582
No comment. But we've strengthened
our monitoring of Sahlgrenska.

308
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:37,915
He claims that Bodin
was behind the Palmer murders-

309
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,999
And poisoned folks with chlorine.
Sick and sad.

310
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:46,665
How did he come in contact
with Zalachenko?

311
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,624
He shoots Zalachenko, goes
for Lisbeth, and it's a coincidence?

312
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,832
I don't know.

313
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:04,874
What if he knew
Karl Axel Bodin was Zalachenko-

314
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,457
And his daughter, Lisbeth.

315
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:13,374
A handful of people knew
Zalachenkos' identity. Not Gullberg.

316
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:17,707
But think again.
This is about something else, huh?

317
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,707
That we shouldn't exclude,
but everything shows-

318
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:29,749
- That there is a confused old
uncle from Gnesta who derailed.

319
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,874
The public prosecutor has withdrawn
Björcks' report.

320
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,332
Because the contents
are classified.

321
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:45,040
It figures.

322
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,707
Talking to you, Vera. Hello.

323
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:02,374
Hey!
Can I get my bag?

324
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,415
Give me the bag!

325
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,082
What the hell!

326
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,165
A guy on a moped snatched my bag.

327
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,915
What? How are you?
Are you okay?

328
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,665
Yeah, I'm good. But Björcks'
investigation was in that bag.

329
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,707
It's okay. I have a copy.

330
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,957
Annie, I'll call you.

331
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,749
- Annie.
- Yes

332
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:25,124
They've snatched my copy, too.
I went home to check.

333
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:30,957
- It's catastrophic.
- That's the least one can say.

334
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:38,207
It's the most powerful evidence for Millenniums' next issue.
The whole thing's collapsed.

335
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,332
No ... Shit, shit, shit!

336
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,457
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

337
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:49,540
- What can we do?
- I don't know.

338
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:55,707
We don't have any evidence against Teleborian
and Björck. It's awful.

339
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:59,999
- Sonny? When did you get out?
- This morning.

340
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,457
- Magge too?
- No, he'll remain there for a while.

341
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:07,290
- Nice to see you. Do you know what happened?
- No idea.

342
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,082
The police did a raid
on the day you were arrested.

343
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:17,207
They found nothing. Then the blond bastard
came here looking for a place to hide.

344
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:20,290
You and Magges' buddy.

345
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:24,415
He's not my pal.
He's hunted throughout Sweden.

346
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:30,040
Therefore, he needed a hideout.
I sent him home to Viktor.

347
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,082
Damn ...

348
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,790
Sonny!

349
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,749
What the hell?

350
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,124
Jenny ... Jenny!

351
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,374
Jenny!

352
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:28,665
Jenny? It's me - Sonny.

353
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,249
Who was it?

354
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,415
Nieder ...

355
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,082
Niedermann.

356
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,249
Viktor, Viktor ...

357
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:48,707
Niedermann ...
He's gonna fucking die for this.

358
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,207
He's gonna fucking die for this.

359
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:04,040
Decent of you to come here.
We don't meet so frequently nowadays.

360
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,499
No, we don't.

361
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:11,624
- Do you live out here permanently now?
- Yes.

362
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:16,624
You know about Evert Gullberg
at Sahlgrenska?

363
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,207
Yes.

364
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,332
I had no fucking clue.

365
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:27,915
- He and Clinton did it all.
- I thought Clinton was dead.

366
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,332
Not entirely.

367
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:36,165
Was he looking for Salander, too?
That's how it sounded on the news.

368
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,332
They should've both been silenced.
And the trial prevented.

369
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,957
That was the idea.

370
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:49,957
- Will he try for Salander again?
- No, it's probably too risky.

371
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:55,207
But Clinton could lock her
in the madhouse again.

372
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:59,207
It's been arranged before.

373
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:09,582
It feels like hell began when I gave
Nils Bjurmans' investigation.

374
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:16,374
There may be a link,
but you couldn't predict it.

375
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:21,082
No, but I think about it
all the time. It hurts me.

376
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:27,165
Don't wear it. Now the report
and it's copies are secure.

377
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,165
So at that point it's over.

378
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,290
What happens now?

379
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,707
I don't know.

380
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:42,832
But I think Clinton
is capable of anything.

381
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,457
Yes, Peter Teleborian.

382
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,415
This is Fred Clinton.

383
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,124
I assume based on Annika
that my phone's being tapped

384
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:01,999
We also assume-

385
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:06,540
- The editorial staff's phones
and your mobile is bugged.

386
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:10,165
So we shouldn't talk on the phones-

387
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,749
- But we will use these
with prepaid cards.

388
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:19,124
We use them only when we're talking about Zalachenko and proceedings with Lisbeth.

389
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:23,499
- Everything else we talk about normally.
- Is email secure?

390
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:28,415
No. We need to think about what we write
and encrypt it.

391
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:33,249
Don't you see? This would mean
that the entire editorial office was bugged.

392
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,415
No, because there's always someone.

393
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,082
Better to be on the safe side.
Any one of us can sleep over.

394
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:44,124
- We'll make a schedule until the trial.
- And get a sore back.

395
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:49,499
Björck's investigation was stolen in two places
on the same day. It's no coincidence.

396
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:55,124
Zalachenko's murdered neither.
Now they're trying to cover his tracks.

397
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:59,415
- The shooter at Sahlgrenska was a mental case.
- Or so they would have us believe.

398
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,874
But I don't think so anymore.

399
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:09,249
Then those who protected Zalachenko
started it. SAPO: then?

400
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:15,999
Yes, it could be SAPO:
but we don't know.

401
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:21,415
But they have great resources
and they're onto us.

402
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:27,540
The good news is that those who listen
to Mikael and Annika's phones-

403
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,665
- don't think we have access
to Björcks' report anymore.

404
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:36,165
And they must continue to believe that.

405
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:45,457
The indictment against Lisbeth Salander
isn't complicated.

406
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:49,665
Even if the plaintiff,
Alexander Zalachenko, is dead.

407
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:56,582
But if the truth about Zalachenko comes to light,
the trial may become more complicated.

408
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:02,457
It relates to human life and Swedish
relations with foreign nations-

409
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:05,999
- And the security police's
top-secret contacts.

410
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:10,290
I read the reports - well, mostly
as background material.

411
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:14,457
In the indictment against Lisbeth Salander
it has no great relevance.

412
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,707
And the Attorney has confiscated it.

413
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,707
But parts of it are useful.

414
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:25,540
Especially since Lisbeth Salander
has tried to kill her father before.

415
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:28,874
I'll see if you can get
access to that part.

416
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,707
Yes, perhaps it could be useful.

417
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,999
Then I'll make sure
you get it.

418
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,582
Who's your boss?

419
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:47,499
My orders come
from the very top.

420
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:51,915
This means that you can't
talk to anyone but me about this.

421
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:57,790
I'll be extremely discreet.

422
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:04,790
- It's Björck.
- Jan Bublanski, violence division.

423
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:10,332
- I propose a meeting.
- Oh, do you? Yeah.

424
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:15,832
I'm involved in an investigation
you can probably help me with.

425
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:19,874
The case of Zalachenko's murder.
You know a lot about him.

426
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,999
I left the service years ago.

427
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:26,874
I was thinking a friendly conversation
between colleagues...

428
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:30,457
- At home with you, maybe?
- I don't think so.

429
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:34,915
Of course I can also send
someone to bring you in.

430
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,040
All right. Come tomorrow, after 11.

431
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:48,749
How can he be so stupid
as to agree to a meeting?

432
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:52,582
What's he thinking?

433
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:59,540
Wasn't it Björck who gave
the Salander-investigation to Bjurman?

434
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,499
Yes, unfortunately.

435
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:10,415
- What's on the menu?
- Oh, yeah. Hamburger today.

436
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,582
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

437
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:22,165
Lisbeth?

438
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:28,415
- Need Help?
- No thanks.

439
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,957
Enjoy your meal.

440
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:38,040
I have a suggestion.

441
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,832
I won't drive home.
I've made a reservation.

442
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,582
Will you sleep over?

443
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:50,207
I'm exhausted.
I hardly slept at the office.

444
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,999
So we'll just sleep.

445
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:57,415
This is the fourth time
I've seen this car here.

446
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,290
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

447
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:38,457
- Anders Jonasson?
- Yes.

448
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,790
Peter Teleborian.

449
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:46,957
I'm the senior consultant at
St. Stephen's psychiatric clinic in Uppsala.

450
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,665
I need to talk to you.

451
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,207
It's about one of your patients.
Lisbeth Salander.

452
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:59,040
- Yes?
- Well... Okay.

453
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:06,790
I've had her under my care
since she was twelve years old-

454
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:11,124
- And I have a very good insight into
her pyschological disorder.

455
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,832
- How does it look?
- Lisbeth is seriously mentally disturbed.

456
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:21,624
She has obvious delusions
with paranoid schizophrenic tendencies.

457
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:27,124
And like all sociopaths
She completely lacks empathy.

458
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:30,207
Simply put...

459
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:36,165
I perceive her as withdrawn,
but not as a paranoid sociopath.

460
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,249
She's extremely manipulative.
It's part of her disease.

461
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:44,332
She shows what she thinks you want to see.

462
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:49,040
Of course, I'm deeply
concerned for her mental condition.

463
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:50,999
I understand that.

464
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:56,665
I'll have to see her to assess
her condition before the trial.

465
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,540
Unfortunately, I can't help you.

466
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,915
I'm responsible for Lisbeth-

467
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,999
- and she's too weak to meet anyone
other than her lawyer.

468
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:14,999
I have the court's authorization
to have a meeting with her.

469
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:21,082
I had hoped to avoid being formal,
between colleagues, but I have to.

470
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:25,707
As her doctor, you should know that
it's my assessment that applies here-

471
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:29,040
- Regardless of what the court says.

472
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,165
So I must ask you to wait patiently
for my assessment to change.

473
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:39,790
Well.

474
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:46,749
I had hoped for a more
professional response.

475
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:39,665
Björck?

476
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:46,249
Hell.

477
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:12,457
Hello. Are you all right?

478
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:31,124
Can you look at it?

479
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:39,374
- How am I doing?
- You're definitely improving.

480
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:47,499
I'll make sure that you get help
To get started with rehabilitation.

481
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:52,707
- I don't need help.
- I think so. Don't scratch the crust.

482
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,540
And you should eat a little better.

483
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,665
You should do something about the food.

484
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,957
- Food?
- Get pizza or something.

485
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,249
I don't know if pizza's in the budget
of the County Council.

486
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:16,999
A Dr. Peter Teleborian
wanted to meet you.

487
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:22,665
He said that you had contact before.

488
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:29,207
He had to go with unfinished business.

489
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,957
Good.

490
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,707
It's been like this with us-

491
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:47,540
We have worked together
for decades-

492
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,999
- Without knowing each other privately.

493
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:56,290
We have worked a long time with Gunnar-

494
00:57:56,625 --> 00:58:01,207
- I knew him as a strong
and reliable employee.

495
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:07,874
The fact that he chose to end
his life by his own hand-

496
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:11,624
- is hard to accept.

497
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:15,124
But it was his choice.

498
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,499
And that I respect.

499
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,915
Can we rule out
that the government's been aware of it?

500
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:27,665
They must've known that a Russian spy
defected to Sweden.

501
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,790
We had a conservative government in 1976,
when Zalachenko defected.

502
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,624
30 years and nothing has leaked out.

503
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:39,249
It wouldn't have been kept secret
if a lot of politicians knew about it.

504
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:42,165
They all write memoirs and biographies now.

505
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,415
It's the same with SAPO.
It'll be leaked sooner or later.

506
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:53,332
It may be a small secret group,
acting entirely on their own.

507
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:55,999
With significant resources
and influence.

508
00:58:56,333 --> 00:59:01,874
If nobody's leaked about that group
in 30 years, where do we start digging?

509
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,374
The best lead we have
is Evert Gullberg.

510
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:10,082
We find something on him,
and perhaps it will lead further.

511
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:13,665
It must not take too much time though,
otherwise Millennium will be in trouble.

512
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,832
The magazine must go on sale,
simultaneously with the day the trial starts.

513
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,332
Suicide by hanging?

514
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:32,915
Gunnar Björck hanged himself
with his belt. That's it.

515
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,749
Who, apart from you, knows
that Bublanski contacted Björk?

516
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,124
Nobody - that I know of.

517
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:54,290
He knew a lot about Zalachenko
and Lisbeth. You've read the investigation.

518
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:03,165
Björck and Zalachenko are dead.
Gullberg tried to silence Lisbeth.

519
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:09,957
- Don't you think it fits together?
- We know nothing about Evert Gullberg.

520
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:15,749
- Conspiracy theories almost never work out.
- No, but it does for me.

521
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:21,540
They are trying to get to Lisbeth,
silence her, and manipulate the trial.

522
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:26,374
This isn't Belarus. You can't
manipulate trials in Sweden.

523
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,957
What are you talking about?

524
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:33,124
I don't know.

525
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:37,915
But the threat to Lisbeth increases.

526
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,540
She's exposed to a new legal
abuse or something far worse.

527
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:38,165
This one was for you.

528
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:05,999
Dr. Jonasson's responsibility for Lisbeth
Salander. It stands over my decision.

529
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:10,415
Yes, indeed,
but I had not anticipated-

530
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,207
- That he would begin to be
awkward and formal.

531
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:18,540
In addition, he refers
to Salander's lawyer-

532
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:22,290
And requires her approval.

533
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:25,082
Is this really correct?

534
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:29,832
Should a lawyer be allowed to impede
a psychiatric examination?

535
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:34,249
Of course not.
That's not like Jonasson.

536
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:39,374
But we have enough respect
for his medical assessment.

537
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:44,082
Salander gets better every day.
You may see her soon.

538
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:50,415
A study like this can take time.
Salander is a complicated case.

539
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,540
Goodbye.

540
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,874
These are from Björck's report,
as I promised you.

541
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,415
One more thing ...

542
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,957
There's been comments
from above-

543
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:21,457
- whether Jan Bublanski
is fit to lead this task.

544
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:25,207
Well?

545
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:29,832
- Will Faste take over the investigation?
- It's not his decision.

546
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:33,665
- Whose is it?
- Someone who believes in Faste.

547
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,665
I refuse to give it to that idiot.
That chauvinistic pig hates Salander.

548
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,499
That says enough about him, Sonja.

549
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:47,540
- I heard that we should split up.
- How long have you known?

550
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:52,207
Since late in the afternoon. Do you think
someone is conspiring with Ekstrom?

551
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,332
Can I get all the material
into my office as soon as possible?

552
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:05,290
- How's the Niedermann investigation?
- Things are going well enough.

553
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,790
I think the bastard's
left the country.

554
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:14,165
I don't like this.
Shit, I don't fucking like this.

555
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:46,874
Hello. We were at the hospital
the same night Lisbeth Salander came.

556
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:51,082
- I remember.
- I want to talk to you about somehing.

557
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:55,165
I won't disclose information
about Lisbeth Salander.

558
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,707
No, I want to give you information
about Lisbeth. Important information.

559
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:08,665
Such a conspiracy! Sorry,
but it sounds very unlikely.

560
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,040
I can very well understand what you think,
but I assure you - everything is true.

561
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,999
Everything can be documented, and
soon, I'll publish the whole story.

562
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:22,915
I'm also helping to build Lisbeth's defense
for her trial. That is why I'm here.

563
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:28,874
- I want to ask you one thing.
- What?

564
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:32,249
Lisbeth has secrets.

565
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:37,624
Private secrets, that she will
need in her defense.

566
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:41,582
To gain access to the evidence
against her, she needs this.

567
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:49,707
- The Prosecutor has forbidden her of communicating.
- So I ask you.

568
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:53,707
We have never faced
a more serious threat.

569
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:58,249
We need to close ranks
and defend ourselves.

570
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:01,290
Do you have anything else?

571
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,207
I just want to know
how Gunnar Björck died.

572
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:10,582
I knew him.
He would never have taken his own life.

573
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:13,624
There are things you never know.

574
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:17,124
I met Gunnar
Four weeks ago.

575
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:21,082
- There's nothing that suggests it.
- Did you meet him?

576
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:26,124
- Where?
- In his house in the country.

577
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:31,332
He just wanted to know what happened
when Gullberg shot Zalachenko.

578
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:34,790
- And there he was told?
- Yes.

579
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,999
Why shouldn't he know it?

580
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:42,165
And now I want to know how Gunnar died.

581
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,624
He hanged himself with his belt.

582
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,624
- Hey, how do you feel?
- Okay.

583
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,957
- Can I examine you?
- Yes.

584
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,874
Let's see...

585
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:07,915
- Does it hurt?
- No.

586
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:12,999
- What about your headaches?
- Okay.

587
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:16,499
- They disappear more and more.
- Good.

588
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,040
The policeman from Stockholm
called again.

589
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:24,832
He introduced himself as
the investigation leader.

590
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,790
He wants to come and question you.

591
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:31,249
Can you bend your head back a bit?

592
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:37,124
Not too much... He was quite annoyed
that we are so stuborn.

593
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:42,332
I can't keep them at bay with the excuse
of your medical condition much longer.

594
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:47,082
- You're getting well too quickly. Do you understand?
- Yes.

595
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:52,165
I said that you need
a couple more weeks.

596
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:58,624
After that you will be moved
to a detention center in Stockholm.

597
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:03,540
I saw the tattoo on your back.
It's quite large.

598
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:07,290
- Why have you done it?
- Why do you ask?

599
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:11,165
- Pure curiosity.
- Private reasons I will not mention.

600
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,749
All right. Sorry.

601
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,790
Oh, wow.

602
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:30,790
It must have hurt and taken time.

603
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:34,374
Yes, it both hurt
and took time.

604
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,999
Sorry.

605
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,790
Hello, Lisbeth. With this you can
tell your version of what happened.

606
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,040
Your autobiography.

607
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:21,874
Annika doesn't know that you have access
to this, and it must remain this way.

608
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:27,540
So this is the man in the black Saab?
Göran Mårtensson?

609
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:32,332
Coastal Hunter. Then the police academy.

610
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:36,749
Worked in the police from '91 to '96.

611
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:40,915
- Then he disappeared from external services.
- SAPO?

612
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:49,040
He is employed by the security police,
but is on loan to the counter-espionage.

613
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,207
They've never
heard of him.

614
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,040
- Do you think they're lying?
- No.

615
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:05,082
When someone tries to hide
and muddle what they're doing...

616
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:09,040
Unfortunately, our contact
knows no more than that.

617
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,540
What now then?

618
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,915
I can ask an old friend, but
then I'll be telling him everything.

619
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,790
- Who is it?
- He's working on the protection of the Constitution.

620
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:24,374
- He can go ahead with it.
- Is he reliable?

621
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:27,957
He's an old friend, Mikael.

622
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,624
- Yeah, okay. We'll be in touch.
- Yeah, all right.

623
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,332
To sum up what you said-

624
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:45,290
- several of the security police
officers connived-

625
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:49,290
- With a range of serious crimes
against a Swedish woman?

626
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:53,707
Had her daughter locked up
in a psychiatric hospital-

627
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:58,915
And gave a free pass to a defecting
Russian spy and his crimes?

628
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:02,790
Yes, it's a good summary.

629
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:07,124
In addition, they broke into
journalist Mikael Blomkvist's home-

630
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:12,874
And assaulted Annika Giannini,
Lisbeth Salander's lawyer.

631
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:17,540
The murder of Zalachenko
must now also be counted.

632
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,999
Constitutional protection must defend
democracy against internal threats,-

633
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:26,415
Usually nazis, anarchists...

634
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:31,999
But now you say that the threat comes
from our own organization?

635
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:38,207
Torsten, you may read it yourself.

636
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,665
See ya.

637
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,374
You are exempted from everything else.

638
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:56,915
Your only job is to investigate
the truth of this.

639
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:03,165
If even half of this is true,
we have a constitutional crisis to manage.

640
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:09,749
You have read the report, I'll find out
who Mårtensson works for.

641
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:13,707
Then you'll examine
Evert Gullbergs' background.

642
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:18,874
I have never heard of him,
but I may have access to the subject.

643
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:24,582
- You report only to me.
- Absolutely.

644
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:30,082
- Plague, are you there?
- Ciao, Wasp. How are you?

645
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:34,207
- I'll live. I need your help.
- Finally.

646
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:40,415
Peter Teleborian, psychiatrist.
I need access to his computer.

647
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:44,290
Send the content to Mikael
Blomkvist's hotmail address.

648
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:49,124
I'll need your help for
the trial. I'll pay 30,000.

649
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:52,374
- Do you have cash?
- Yes.

650
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,749
Mårtensson lives in Vällingby.

651
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:04,374
Lars Falusson is an old offender
who's now a locksmith.

652
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:07,832
A popular craft, apparently.

653
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:11,999
- Then they waited out Blomkvist?
- Yes, exactly.

654
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:36,082
- How long were they there?
- 40 Minutes.

655
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:41,082
- Mårtensson snooped around a lot.
- Did Blomkvist see them?

656
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,832
I didn't realize her presence
before I saw her there.

657
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:47,915
She filmed Mårtensson and Falusson.

658
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:51,957
- She works for Milton Security.
- Susanne Linder.

659
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:55,165
She was a cop until '98.

660
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:00,374
- Blomkvist hired Milton?
- It seems so.

661
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:04,540
The camera is between the lamp
and the roof in a recess.

662
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:11,415
We can fast forward if you don't
want to watch him tinker.

663
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:22,124
You can probably count on your apartment
being bugged now, Mikael.

664
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,457
We can remove it, if you want.

665
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:29,790
So revealing that you know
you're being watched.

666
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:35,457
No, let it be.
I can live in a different place.

667
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:57,832
It's okay to give the DVD to Annika;
but I'll write about the rape itself.

668
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:01,624
I've contacted Plague about Teleborian.

669
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:05,874
He will contact you
if he can find something.

670
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:48,582
We'll look for old ones. Judging from the color
it should be something from 1910.

671
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,957
That's right.
It doesn't look recent.

672
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:55,290
Don't you have a better picture
of Zalachenko?

673
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:04,707
You look tired. Don't you sleep
well when your husband is away?

674
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:16,290
Hello, hello. I have found
the connection to the government.

675
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:22,332
Guess who visited the Prime Minister
on October 5th, 1976?

676
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:28,249
Nobody? An Evert Gullberg and somebody
who called himself Hans von Rotting.

677
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,832
They were there three weeks after
Zalachenko defected.

678
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:36,499
- How did you find out?
- I checked the visitors book.

679
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:40,957
There was only one visit
on the 5th of October 1976.

680
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:44,207
Well done, Christer.

681
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:50,707
But we must prove that they were
there to inform him about Zalachenko.

682
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:56,665
- Were there any notes?
- No, just the name and date.

683
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:02,707
- How do we proceed?
- We drive to look at the State Secretaries.

684
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:07,457
- The two who worked there may know something.
- Do we have any names?

685
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,082
One is dead and the other is
a retired ambassador.

686
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:14,874
His name is Bengt Janeryd,
he lives outside Grisslehamn.

687
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:19,707
- We should have a chat with him.
- Good. I'll do it.

688
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:24,124
I know the material better than you
and I'm more dangerous to him.

689
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,665
- It's just what I say.
- Yeah, I heard it...

690
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,040
Address?

691
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,082
Yes.

692
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:44,290
You ...

693
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,499
Fucking well done.

694
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,790
Yes, Ekstrom.

695
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,624
Prosecutor Ekstrom just called.

696
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:51,457
- Can we take it later?
- No, this is serious.

697
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:58,124
Ekstrom was called anonymously,
someone wanted to talk about Zalachenko.

698
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:03,290
He wanted to talk about serious crimes being
committed during the preliminary investigation.

699
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:05,707
What crimes?

700
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:11,499
Ekstrom asked him to call back
in the afternoon and then phoned me.

701
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:17,415
The caller knows about the
investigation and Zalachenko.

702
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:25,290
If he calls again make sure
Ekstrom says yes to a meeting.

703
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:29,915
But explain that we're taking over now.

704
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:34,707
Emphasize it's a matter
of national security.

705
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:38,540
Choose an appropriate meeting place.

706
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:43,499
- Ekström.
- I called before about Zalachenko.

707
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:47,457
Of course, I'll hear
what you have to say over here.

708
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:52,499
- I'm busy now, but later in the evening?
- When?

709
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:56,707
- Nine o'clock would suit me.
- Nine o'clock's fine.

710
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:23,915
You must have understood that Gullberg
shot Zalachenko, right?

711
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,957
- You read the newspapers?
- Yeah.

712
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:33,582
- Why didn't you call the police?
- I was waiting for them to call me.

713
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:37,832
- It sounds a little convenient.
- I knew nothing about his daughter.

714
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:41,040
What she was subjected to is terrible.

715
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,915
But the prime minister didn't know about it.

716
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,624
Me neither.

717
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,874
You must convince both me
and Millennium readers about that.

718
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:56,707
I forbid you to use
my name in this context.

719
01:20:57,041 --> 01:21:00,082
I haven't had anything
to do with it.

720
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,332
What I read here is news to me.

721
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:08,999
You have read some of the material
we'll publish. We have a lot more.

722
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,374
Everything can be proven.

723
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:16,374
I won't hang you out to dry,
but you have a responsibility and a debt.

724
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:20,915
Tell me what you know, and you will be a
confidential source. If not, I will expose you.

725
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,290
- I call that blackmail.
- Call it what you want.

726
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:28,874
Tell me and I promise
not to publish your name.

727
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:36,957
The Prime Minister informed me
about that meeting in October 1976.

728
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,249
He thought it was very uncomfortable.

729
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:49,165
It was the largest military
secret in Sweden that I know of.

730
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,999
So he was under a lot of pressure.

731
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:55,582
How many times did they meet
after the first meeting?

732
01:21:55,916 --> 01:22:00,249
They didn't meet.
He didn't want to do it.

733
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:04,957
He made sure I was the intermediary
between him and the person-

734
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:08,124
- Who was in charge of Zalachenko.

735
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:14,290
I had to promise never to discuss
it with anybody and I've never done so.

736
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,249
The prime minister was in contact with Evert
Gullberg and Hans von Rottinger.

737
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:22,915
- Did you also meet with them?
- Yes.

738
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:27,874
There was a man: Clinton.
As the American president.

739
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:29,749
- Clinton?
- Yes.

740
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:32,915
How often did you meet?

741
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,665
About a dozen times during my time
as Secretary of State.

742
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,874
I didn't know anything.
Just that Zalachenko collaborated-

743
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:46,040
And that the information he gave
was invaluable.

744
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,124
Where did you meet?

745
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:52,832
Various places.
Often in apartments around town.

746
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:56,207
Who took over the connection
after the change of government?

747
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:58,707
I don't know.

748
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,624
- You handed over to no one?
- No.

749
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:05,249
You didn't report?

750
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:09,124
No, everything was, of course, top secret.

751
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:12,874
I hadn't even been allowed
to take notes during meetings.

752
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:17,832
So no subsequent government
had an idea-

753
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:22,124
- That there was a Soviet defector
in Sweden?

754
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:27,207
It sounds strange,
but it was so.

755
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:56,249
Hello, Mikael Blomkvist. Monica
Figuerola, Constitutional protection.

756
01:23:56,583 --> 01:24:00,499
- Yeah?
- I would like to invite you to a chat.

757
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,832
It is a friendly invitation.
You risk nothing.

758
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:10,999
- Can I get my mail?
- Of course.

759
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,915
- And a pair of clean underpants?
- Absolutely.

760
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:45,457
Torsten Edklinth,
constitutional protection.

761
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,874
- Blomkvist.
- Please sit down.

762
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:54,124
You will understand
why we want to meet you.

763
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:57,332
So let's get right to it.

764
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:03,624
We have received confirmation of the
existence of a conspiracy-

765
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:08,249
- Within an exceptionally sensitive area
of state administration.

766
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:15,999
My meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday
resulted in the launch of a full investigation.

767
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,915
Which means ...?

768
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,665
A full investigation.

769
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:30,040
The result is given to the Attorney-General
who will decide whether prosecution should be instituted.

770
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:39,624
But we need time to identify
who is involved.

771
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:43,374
I understand very well.
Where do I fit in?

772
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:46,290
We want to know when you intend to publish.

773
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:51,332
If it's done before the investigation is concluded,
it could jeopardize the entire operation.

774
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:56,415
When can I
publish the proceedings?

775
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:00,165
It's obviously not something
we can determine.

776
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:05,040
It's totally up to you,
but we do ask that you cooperate.

777
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:15,374
What I can say is this ...

778
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:19,707
I am furious at the state,
Government, SAPO-

779
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:23,999
- And all the other fucking assholes
who put a 12-year-old girl in-

780
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:29,665
- a psychiatric ward without reason
and legally incapacitated her.

781
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,957
I myself am very upset about
what happened to Lisbeth Salander.

782
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:37,499
Those responsible will be punished.

783
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:44,290
But before that, we must identify
who's involved.

784
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:46,582
I would also like that.

785
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:53,290
But I also want Lisbeth Salander to be
acquitted and cleared with the authorities.

786
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:58,874
Then we or the government can't
intervene, you understand.

787
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:17,874
If I can gain insight into the investigation-

788
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:21,749
- I will tell what I intend to publish,
and when.

789
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:24,915
Information for information.

790
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,207
This can be solved fairly quickly.

791
01:27:30,541 --> 01:27:35,957
We decide which employees
we recruit for the investigation.

792
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:40,915
We can hire Blomkvist
as an external consultant.

793
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:51,415
Evert Gullberg.
Do you have any more names?

794
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:56,499
Hans von Rotssinger, Fred Clinton.
One is dead, the other is retired.

795
01:27:56,833 --> 01:28:00,957
- Both active in the group of '70-'80's.
- Group?

796
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:05,624
Can we give it a working title?
We can call it the Section.

797
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:09,165
Section? Sure.

798
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,540
How did you come up with that?

799
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:17,499
I have a good source.

800
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:22,999
- Can we keep hold of this place?
- I will sort it out.

801
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,832
What the hell?

802
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:25,374
Lisbeth tried several times
to tell the authorities-

803
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:29,749
- of Zalachenkos' assault
on her mother-

804
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:34,874
- But no one took the ten-year-old
girls' allegations seriously.

805
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:38,207
Only when she tried
to kill her father-

806
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:44,374
- To save her mother, did
society react.

807
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:49,999
But not by arresting and punishing
Alexander Zalachenko.

808
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:53,165
Instead, Lisbeth was punished.

809
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,790
at the age of twelve she was
forcibly taken away and locked up-

810
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:01,915
- At St. Stephen's Psychiatric
Hospital in Uppsala.

811
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:07,624
I tried to explain what happened
to Peter Teleborian-

812
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:12,040
- But he would not listen
and claimed that I fantasized.

813
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:16,457
I was strapped to the bed
as a punishment.

814
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,999
During the two years I was locked up -

815
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:24,207
- I was strapped to my bed
for 381 days.

816
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:35,832
Hello, Lisbeth.

817
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,624
How are you?

818
01:35:14,749 --> 01:35:18,498
My assessment stands,
whatever the prosecutor decides.

819
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:22,498
We just do our job.
Want to argue about it.

820
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:25,332
What should we discuss?

821
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:28,498
That door should stay closed!

822
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:35,623
What the hell?

823
01:35:36,624 --> 01:35:40,332
I was admitted.
You were not here when we arrived.

824
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:42,957
Get out of here.

825
01:35:57,041 --> 01:36:00,290
The prosecutor decided it.

826
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:12,957
Lisbeth?

827
01:36:13,999 --> 01:36:16,415
Look at me. What did he do?

828
01:36:16,749 --> 01:36:22,248
It went too far. That won't
happen again. I promise you.

829
01:36:41,749 --> 01:36:44,040
Right.

830
01:36:45,624 --> 01:36:49,623
- Take care of his car.
- No problem.

831
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:16,748
We waited for over an hour.
Maybe he misunderstood the place.

832
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:19,790
- But he never showed up.
- Strange.

833
01:37:20,124 --> 01:37:24,998
If he contacts you again,
you must notify me, immediately.

834
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:30,290
- Whose turn is it today?
- It's Malin's luck, huh?

835
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,707
Hello. How's it going?

836
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:38,123
- Sushi, is that okay?
- Not fish. Chicken teriyaki for me.

837
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:41,873
- Are you going to have lunch, Mike?
- No, I don't have time.

838
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:47,582
You sleep with the light on at night.
I see you. What am I?

839
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:47,582
All right. Erika, eight pieces?

840
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:51,790
May I change the battery with you?
Mine's flat.

841
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,665
Micke ... Look.

842
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:03,373
It's anonymous.
I think it's the same author as the last one.

843
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:07,040
- Have you had many?
- I got one last week.

844
01:38:07,374 --> 01:38:10,957
- Why haven't you said anything?
- I didn't take it seriously.

845
01:38:15,874 --> 01:38:19,040
Let's keep it between us,
we'll talk about that later.

846
01:38:19,374 --> 01:38:21,915
- May I take it there?
- Take it.

847
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:28,582
- Will you have eight pieces?
- I'm not so hungry today.

848
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:31,040
I'll skip it.

849
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:37,957
I was strapped to the bed.
Peter Teleborian stood beside it.

850
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:42,290
He smelled of aftershave.
I hated his smell.

851
01:38:42,624 --> 01:38:45,748
He wanted to make me happy
on my birthday.

852
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:50,498
I hated his voice.
I hated his hands.

853
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:55,082
It was the night I was 13 years old.

854
01:38:57,333 --> 01:39:00,415
- Teleborians' opinion?
- A draft.

855
01:39:00,749 --> 01:39:04,082
It needs to be processed,
but it looks good.

856
01:39:07,624 --> 01:39:10,915
We've had an unexpected problem.

857
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:16,082
- Wadensjöö disappeared.
- disappeared?

858
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:21,123
Yes, his wife made a police report
in Bromma yesterday.

859
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:25,415
Last time she saw him was on friday morning.

860
01:39:25,749 --> 01:39:30,332
Is there a risk that he defected
and told everything?

861
01:39:30,666 --> 01:39:35,582
- Would Bertil do it?
- No, Bertil has always been loyal.

862
01:39:37,874 --> 01:39:42,623
I think it feels
damn uncomfortable.

863
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:04,248
- What is it?
- We have a problem.

864
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:08,998
I checked Teleborians' hard disk
and mailbox and found nothing.

865
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:13,248
- Nothing?
- Nothing about you or the trial.

866
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:16,873
The only thing that can mean anything
are short emails from ...

867
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:20,332
Jonas on Hotmail.

868
01:40:21,374 --> 01:40:26,998
"PSO 1 clear next week."
Dating from 20 September this year.

869
01:40:27,333 --> 01:40:32,540
The second is equally brief:
"PSO 2 clear tomorrow."

870
01:40:32,874 --> 01:40:38,165
PSO? Psychiatric opinion?
Or?

871
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:41,248
Yes, it could be.

872
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,373
- No files?
- No.

873
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:47,040
He hasn't sent anything
from his office computer.

874
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:51,165
He'll have a laptop
with mobile broadband.

875
01:40:51,499 --> 01:40:56,123
- It could be difficult to access.
- But not impossible?

876
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:58,707
At the right time, everything is possible.

877
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:06,165
- I can keep track of his mailbox.
- Do it. But don't call anymore.

878
01:41:06,499 --> 01:41:09,373
- SMS messages or email.
- Okay, bye.

879
01:41:10,374 --> 01:41:11,582
Damn!

880
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:15,873
The trial begins on the 13th.
The magazine must be ready by then.

881
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:18,832
We need to go to press the week before.

882
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:23,207
- How will this be done?
- We must help each other.

883
01:41:24,374 --> 01:41:30,207
You and Malin write about Teleborians
background and a little about St. Stephens.

884
01:41:30,541 --> 01:41:33,498
Around 30 pages. Is this okay?

885
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:36,123
- Yes, it'll be okay.
- Good.

886
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:40,582
Yes ...

887
01:41:41,666 --> 01:41:44,540
There's something else of importance.

888
01:41:46,916 --> 01:41:51,248
I received two anonymous threats by mail-

889
01:41:51,583 --> 01:41:54,832
- Last Week.
Thought you should know.

890
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:57,498
Threats?

891
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:05,873
Christ!
Who the hell sent them?

892
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:09,582
- Have you notified the police?
- I don't want the police here.

893
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:13,415
It's a serious threat to Erika.

894
01:42:13,749 --> 01:42:19,040
We take it seriously. I don't want
to have the police at the office.

895
01:42:19,374 --> 01:42:23,915
- So we'll just sit on it?
- That's not what I said.

896
01:42:24,249 --> 01:42:26,582
- Let me fix it my way.
- How?

897
01:42:26,916 --> 01:42:31,248
The police don't care about that sort of thing.
They don't give a shit!

898
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:35,707
Please, stop! Oh my God!

899
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:41,040
May we skip it? No harm was done.
Now we leave it.

900
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:45,332
30 pages?

901
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:49,540
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Yeah.

902
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:57,623
I have to hurry.

903
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:23,998
It's me.

904
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:28,498
Teleborian meets with Jonas
at four o'clock at the Center.

905
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,123
- What time is it?
- Half past three.

906
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:31,998
Damn!

907
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:40,457
- Hello. I need to take some blood.
- I have to go to the toilet first.

908
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:07,873
- Yes, it's Christer.
- I'm in the middle of the staircase.

909
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:12,790
Yes, I see you now.
I'm just below.

910
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:19,915
Now I can see Teleborian.
Christer, go ahead. I'll stop here.

911
01:44:20,249 --> 01:44:21,998
All right.

912
01:44:22,333 --> 01:44:26,582
You should see him soon.
Black jacket.

913
01:44:26,916 --> 01:44:29,957
I see him now.
He's standing there, waiting.

914
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:34,873
- Watch him, not too close.
- No, I'm watching.

915
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:38,373
Someone is coming.
Must be Jonas.

916
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:41,832
Gray jacket, middle-aged.
I don't recognize him.

917
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:45,998
- Now they're leaving. Should I follow?
- Yes, follow them!

918
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:49,707
- They're going out towards Vasagatan.
- Follow them!

919
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:04,207
Mikael here. Teleborian has a meeting
with an agent of the Section.

920
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:08,290
- Okay. Where?
- At Vasagatan. Are you coming?

921
01:45:08,624 --> 01:45:11,082
Okay. Yes, I'm on my way.

922
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:32,707
- Hi.
- Hi.

923
01:45:33,749 --> 01:45:35,832
They're there.

924
01:45:58,749 --> 01:46:01,915
- Mikael.
- They're leaving now.

925
01:46:02,249 --> 01:46:06,040
Follow Teleborian.
We'll follow the other guy.

926
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:17,373
Monica here. I need information on
a car registration.

927
01:46:33,874 --> 01:46:38,332
Teleborian has gone from the meeting
with Jonas Sandberg from the Section-

928
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:41,665
- To a meeting at Police Headquarters?

929
01:46:44,124 --> 01:46:46,207
- With whom?
- Let's see ...

930
01:46:46,541 --> 01:46:52,540
Jonas Sandberg was recruited
into counter-intelligence in 1998.

931
01:46:52,874 --> 01:46:57,498
In 2001, he was transferred
to a secret location abroad.

932
01:46:57,833 --> 01:47:01,957
He should be located at the Embassy in
Madrid, but they've never heard of him.

933
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:07,665
Same with Göran Mårtensson. Officially
moved to a place where he's not.

934
01:47:07,999 --> 01:47:11,540
It can only go through
Secretary Albert Schenke.

935
01:47:11,874 --> 01:47:14,582
The Section dwells in that house here.

936
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:17,665
A six-story,
23 flats condominium.

937
01:47:17,999 --> 01:47:23,040
I've checked all the tenants
but there's nothing unusual.

938
01:47:23,374 --> 01:47:28,915
Except the apartment at the very top.
Eleven rooms and a kitchen.

939
01:47:29,249 --> 01:47:33,082
It's owned by the company Bellona.
The owners live abroad.

940
01:47:33,416 --> 01:47:35,915
- Can we get a camera in?
- Do we have a warrant?

941
01:47:36,249 --> 01:47:40,832
I'll get the warrant if you make
some tea.

942
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:45,457
Never mind... I'll make it.

943
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:54,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

944
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,415
- Am I disturbing you?
- hmm.

945
01:47:59,749 --> 01:48:03,373
- I'll come back.
- I'm almost done.

946
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:18,957
I just wanted to warn you that
the police will come tomorrow.

947
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:20,790
All right.

948
01:48:21,124 --> 01:48:26,707
I could postpone the transfer
a couple of days further, but...

949
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:30,665
- My colleagues would start to wonder.
- Then you shouldn't.

950
01:48:30,999 --> 01:48:33,123
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

951
01:48:34,999 --> 01:48:39,123
- You don't seem particularly worried.
- No.

952
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,832
I have a gift for you.

953
01:48:46,166 --> 01:48:48,248
Why?

954
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:54,998
You have been one of my most
interesting patients in a long time.

955
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:04,832
If you're bored in jail, this is the
latest in DNA research.

956
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:13,832
- Your mobile ...?
- It's in the chocolate box.

957
01:49:54,999 --> 01:49:58,373
Teleborian will write an
expert opinion.

958
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:03,415
He will report that you need treatment
at his psychiatric hospital.

959
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:07,665
The prosecutor requested this of him.

960
01:50:07,999 --> 01:50:14,248
But we'll hire our own expert
who has his own opinion.

961
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:19,790
Lisbeth, this is for your own good.

962
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:25,373
I don't talk to any brain-bending doctors.
I've already said it.

963
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:39,123
Hope they fit.

964
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:46,165
You need to sort your attitude,
it could lose this case for us.

965
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:52,582
Lisbeth...

966
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:35,248
- Move!
- Lisbeth Salander ...

967
01:51:39,291 --> 01:51:41,623
Do you have any comment?

968
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:58,540
Murder Suspect Lisbeth Salander
was transferred today by police escort-

969
01:51:58,874 --> 01:52:03,623
- From Sahlgrenska in Göteborg
to the Kronobergs' jail in Stockholm.

970
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:07,540
According to prosecutor Richard Ekstrom
the trial is-

971
01:52:07,874 --> 01:52:10,707
- Scheduled for November 6.

972
01:52:11,041 --> 01:52:14,248
Lisbeth Salander is accused-

973
01:52:14,583 --> 01:52:18,540
- Of the attempted murder of her father,
Alexander Zalachenko-

974
01:52:18,874 --> 01:52:23,040
- Who was later brutally murdered
at Sahlgrenska Hospital.

975
01:52:23,374 --> 01:52:28,082
There will be increased
security during the trial-

976
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:32,748
- Since some threats occurred
during the police investigation.

977
01:52:44,624 --> 01:52:47,040
Here we have Georg Nyström.

978
01:52:47,374 --> 01:52:50,748
Inspector, he's worked
in Security Service since 1983.

979
01:52:51,083 --> 01:52:54,540
Since 1996 he's been an
independent investigator.

980
01:52:54,874 --> 01:52:59,040
He makes internal controls on
cases that the Security Service completed.

981
01:52:59,374 --> 01:53:02,665
Here is Jonas Sandberg again.

982
01:53:02,999 --> 01:53:07,165
- Who is that?
- A neighbor, Karl Birgersson.

983
01:53:07,499 --> 01:53:11,373
- Him I recognize ... Hallberg.
- Yes, Otto Hallberg.

984
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:15,415
He worked on anti-terrorism
15 years ago.

985
01:53:15,749 --> 01:53:18,457
He resigned 9 years ago.
Has his own firm now.

986
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:21,957
Guess who he had lunch with today.

987
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:24,207
Your looking at it.

988
01:53:24,541 --> 01:53:28,373
Secretary Albert Schenke
and Budget Director Atterbom.

989
01:53:28,708 --> 01:53:33,665
That's how they get their money.
Everything is falling into place.

990
01:53:33,999 --> 01:53:39,082
- I want a tag on them around the clock.
- So we need more people.

991
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:43,332
- What do you think about Jan Bublanski?
- Absolutely reliable.

992
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:50,040
- Got his hands full with Niedermann?
- No. He's probably left the country.

993
01:54:01,291 --> 01:54:03,915
You need to come for questioning.

994
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:23,707
Yes, so we finally meet.

995
01:54:24,041 --> 01:54:27,290
Ekstrom, prosecutor.

996
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:41,332
This initial meeting is more of a
conversation rather than an interrogation.

997
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:45,665
So we can try to get a handle
on this complicated story.

998
01:54:45,999 --> 01:54:50,082
I assume that you don't
have anything against this.

999
01:54:51,749 --> 01:54:54,832
The charges against you
are very serious.

1000
01:54:55,166 --> 01:55:01,248
But as the prosecutor, I should take into
account all mitigating circumstances.

1001
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:06,415
It's important that you're aware
of it, for your own sake.

1002
01:55:11,499 --> 01:55:14,457
This is a simple question.
Answer yes or no.

1003
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:17,498
When you went to Gosseberga
to meet your father-

1004
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:21,832
- Were you already planning
to kill him?

1005
01:55:24,499 --> 01:55:29,373
I must ask the lawyer again to
get Salander to respond.

1006
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:35,748
So I must repeat again that my client
will decide whether she will respond.

1007
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:49,707
I ask the lawyer to have a serious
talk with Miss Salander.

1008
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:55,040
This is, as I say, for her own sake.

1009
01:56:01,333 --> 01:56:03,498
Yes ...

1010
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:08,790
I was surprised that she was
so small and slender as a girl.

1011
01:56:09,124 --> 01:56:13,123
- How did Lisbeth Salander do?
- Well under the circumstances.

1012
01:56:13,458 --> 01:56:16,623
- What about the allegations?
- No comments.

1013
01:56:16,958 --> 01:56:20,748
You are defending her
and have to say something.

1014
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:28,040
Here is Lisbeth's autobiography.

1015
01:56:29,874 --> 01:56:33,832
- When did she write it?
- Does anybody care?

1016
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:36,457
She's expected to participate in hearings.

1017
01:56:36,791 --> 01:56:41,207
- So, physically, she has recovered.
- But not mentally?

1018
01:56:41,541 --> 01:56:46,165
It's known that Lisbeth Salander, for several
years, has been treated in mental hospitals.

1019
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:50,040
You mean Lisbeth Salander
still is mentally ill?

1020
01:56:50,374 --> 01:56:53,582
I cannot make that diagnosis.

1021
01:56:53,916 --> 01:56:58,540
I've sought a psychiatric
examination to get answers.

1022
01:56:58,874 --> 01:57:03,957
It's made by Dr Peter Teleborian
at St. Stephen's Hospital in Uppsala.

1023
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:07,998
Peter Teleborian ...
What a surprise.

1024
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:12,623
Is there a risk that the
trial will be postponed?

1025
01:57:12,958 --> 01:57:18,998
No, the police investigation progresses
as well as the proceedings.

1026
01:57:20,499 --> 01:57:22,415
ERIKA. IS IT YOUR STYLE: OR DID YOU BUY SOME-
THING FOR GREGER? HE'LL BE HOME ON SATURDAY. AFRAID, ERIKA? YOU SHOULD BE.

1027
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:30,082
Christer?

1028
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:39,915
- Is it from the same sender?
- Yes.

1029
01:57:44,958 --> 01:57:48,123
"It'll get worse now.
Everything's complete"

1030
01:57:48,458 --> 01:57:50,498
Is it us?

1031
01:57:50,833 --> 01:57:54,457
- Micke traced the sender?
- He called somebody.

1032
01:57:54,791 --> 01:57:58,248
It hasn't helped.
We might call and report it.

1033
01:57:58,583 --> 01:58:03,040
- We can't just wait until it happens
- I want to talk to Mikael first.

1034
01:58:03,374 --> 01:58:08,207
- I'll call them.
- No. I'm the publisher.

1035
01:58:08,541 --> 01:58:13,207
It is I who has received the email.
I don't go behind Mikaels' back.

1036
01:58:14,791 --> 01:58:19,332
We must stick together.
And agree. Especially now.

1037
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:25,373
I'll call Mickael.

1038
01:58:44,374 --> 01:58:46,748
Hello, Lisbeth.

1039
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:57,082
You should know that I'm sorry that
you've ended up in this situation.

1040
01:58:58,249 --> 01:59:01,832
I'll try to help you in
every possible way I can.

1041
01:59:03,624 --> 01:59:09,748
I hope we can work
together, you and me.

1042
01:59:11,666 --> 01:59:17,082
I thought we got to know
each other pretty well.

1043
01:59:17,416 --> 01:59:19,790
At the time.

1044
01:59:20,999 --> 01:59:23,457
You were stubborn-

1045
01:59:23,791 --> 01:59:28,707
And unusually difficult to treat
at twelve years old.

1046
01:59:31,374 --> 01:59:34,248
You bit my finger once.

1047
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:37,873
Do you remember that?

1048
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:44,915
You never understood that contact
can be a part of the treatment-

1049
01:59:45,249 --> 01:59:49,540
- That creates closeness and trust.

1050
01:59:51,458 --> 01:59:54,582
This applies especially to children.

1051
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:02,540
Do you realize that I'm the person-

1052
02:00:02,874 --> 02:00:06,582
- With the greatest opportunity
to help you?

1053
02:00:11,333 --> 02:00:13,415
Do you?

1054
02:00:21,333 --> 02:00:26,373
- Hello. Are you still here?
- I called several times.

1055
02:00:26,708 --> 02:00:30,582
I was writing and had turned it off.

1056
02:00:32,541 --> 02:00:35,040
Same sender.

1057
02:00:37,958 --> 02:00:43,082
Chriser tried to call the police
today. But I stopped him.

1058
02:00:45,083 --> 02:00:48,540
We must solve this now, Mickael.

1059
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:52,498
You and I run the newspaper.

1060
02:00:52,833 --> 02:00:57,457
We have a responsibility to our employees.
This is not just the two of us anymore.

1061
02:00:57,791 --> 02:01:01,832
I've had contact with one of Lisbeth's
hacker friends, Plague.

1062
02:01:02,166 --> 02:01:04,540
So we don't need the police?

1063
02:01:04,874 --> 02:01:09,123
If anyone can find the sender
it is him, but it takes some time.

1064
02:01:09,458 --> 02:01:12,165
It's faster than the police.

1065
02:01:12,499 --> 02:01:15,873
Are we talking days? Or weeks?

1066
02:01:20,041 --> 02:01:22,373
Honestly, I don't know.

1067
02:01:36,374 --> 02:01:40,873
Mrs. Giannini, I believe that your
Client should avoid trial.

1068
02:01:42,124 --> 02:01:44,832
This so-called autobiography-

1069
02:01:45,166 --> 02:01:48,957
- Containing unsubstantiated
and senseless accusations-

1070
02:01:49,291 --> 02:01:52,207
- against Peter Teleborian
and sollicitor Bjurman.

1071
02:01:52,541 --> 02:01:54,665
I know the contents.

1072
02:01:54,999 --> 02:02:00,165
But doesn't it prove that Lisbeth
Salander is in need of care?

1073
02:02:00,499 --> 02:02:02,290
No.

1074
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:05,873
- For there is an option.
- What?

1075
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:11,248
That what's written there is true
and that the people choose to believe it.

1076
02:02:11,583 --> 02:02:16,748
If we assume that Millennium
has something to publish-

1077
02:02:17,083 --> 02:02:19,040
- What can they have?

1078
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:25,415
Worst case scenario:
A copy of Björcks' investigation.

1079
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:31,248
They may not know
anything about us.

1080
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:37,123
But he has great credibility.
And so does the magazine.

1081
02:02:42,166 --> 02:02:46,957
We could reduce
that credibility in some way?

1082
02:02:51,708 --> 02:02:54,415
Do what you want...

1083
02:02:54,749 --> 02:02:59,123
We have to put an end to this,
once and for all.

1084
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:40,248
She phoned at quarter past
three in the night.

1085
02:03:40,583 --> 02:03:44,082
She had locked herself
in a room upstairs.

1086
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:47,707
- We were there 20 minutes later.
- Do you have any leads?

1087
02:03:48,041 --> 02:03:53,165
The police should investigate.
We're installing alarms in the house now.

1088
02:03:54,208 --> 02:03:56,998
Erika told me about the email threats.

1089
02:03:57,333 --> 02:04:00,290
They're probably linked
with what happened last night.

1090
02:04:00,624 --> 02:04:04,207
My contact's trying to trace them.
I don't want to involve the police.

1091
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:08,832
It's time now. It's about direct
physical threats against you and Erika.

1092
02:04:09,166 --> 02:04:11,248
- Against me?
- Yes, against you as well.

1093
02:04:11,583 --> 02:04:14,957
Your silent alarm in the apartment
went off last night.

1094
02:04:20,958 --> 02:04:26,540
He was in there 17 minutes.
When we searched the apartment-

1095
02:04:26,874 --> 02:04:31,457
- We found 180 grams of cocaine
hidden in one of your speakers-

1096
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:36,207
- And 120,000 Kroner in cash
in your closet.

1097
02:04:36,541 --> 02:04:39,623
- What the hell?
- They're trying to discredit you-

1098
02:04:39,958 --> 02:04:43,373
As they can't discredit the magazine.

1099
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:47,290
- Is it still there?
- The money's still there.

1100
02:04:47,624 --> 02:04:49,748
The other has been removed.

1101
02:04:55,374 --> 02:05:00,332
- I'll have to call Erika.
- I think she's asleep.

1102
02:05:08,416 --> 02:05:11,165
- Erika.
- Hey. It's me.

1103
02:05:17,583 --> 02:05:19,748
I know what's happened.

1104
02:05:20,083 --> 02:05:24,665
- I want us to talk. Can I come over?
- No, you shouldn't come here.

1105
02:05:25,708 --> 02:05:27,790
We'll talk it over later.

1106
02:05:28,124 --> 02:05:31,623
- I want to see you now.
- I have to sleep for a few hours.

1107
02:05:35,541 --> 02:05:37,165
Three o'clock?

1108
02:05:37,499 --> 02:05:39,998
Samirs Gryta?

1109
02:05:41,041 --> 02:05:45,790
- Will you or won't you come?
- At three o'clock. I'll be there.

1110
02:05:46,124 --> 02:05:48,832
- Good. Bye.
- Bye.

1111
02:05:52,249 --> 02:05:56,165
- Hi. Do you know where Erika is?
- No.

1112
02:05:56,499 --> 02:06:01,832
She doesn't answer when I call.
Today's the deadline for the printer.

1113
02:06:02,166 --> 02:06:06,457
- I'm going to get in touch with her.
- Good. You have a visitor up there.

1114
02:06:18,583 --> 02:06:21,457
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1115
02:06:21,791 --> 02:06:27,873
Teleborian has written an opinion
to which I'm unable to respond.

1116
02:06:29,958 --> 02:06:34,748
The court will believe that.
If you read it, you'll realize I'm right.

1117
02:06:35,083 --> 02:06:39,457
He has fabricated it
together with the Section.

1118
02:06:39,791 --> 02:06:44,165
- If we can prove it ...
- How could that be?

1119
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:51,207
No. I must postpone the trial and convince
Lisbeth to undergo another evaluation.

1120
02:06:51,541 --> 02:06:54,373
But she won't help.

1121
02:06:54,708 --> 02:06:56,665
No.

1122
02:06:57,708 --> 02:07:01,707
I'm seriously considering
giving up.

1123
02:07:14,249 --> 02:07:17,457
Samirs Gryta. You know it?

1124
02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:20,540
At three in the afternoon.

1125
02:07:22,416 --> 02:07:26,290
So I'll send these pages
to the printer.

1126
02:07:26,624 --> 02:07:29,332
Haven't you heard from Erica?

1127
02:07:29,666 --> 02:07:34,332
I talked to her. She was feeling
bad last night and wanted to sleep today.

1128
02:07:34,666 --> 02:07:38,582
- How is she now?
- Better. Damn, I gotta go.

1129
02:07:38,916 --> 02:07:41,332
Has she received more threatening emails?

1130
02:07:41,666 --> 02:07:46,373
We've really done excellent work
with this issue together.

1131
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:50,998
- Shall we all have a beer later?
- No, I have a meeting at Samir.

1132
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:55,873
There's an uncertainty
about how many people-

1133
02:07:56,208 --> 02:07:59,623
- Are linked to the Section's activities.

1134
02:07:59,958 --> 02:08:03,748
In addition, There may be several more
people we don't know yet.

1135
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:08,915
The key people we've already identified,
and they'll be arrested in a major joint action.

1136
02:08:09,249 --> 02:08:12,915
I'll give more information about this later.

1137
02:08:13,249 --> 02:08:20,540
It's ten minutes to three. We'll pause,
and gather here again in an hour.

1138
02:08:22,416 --> 02:08:25,748
- Has there been any developments today?
- Clinton's been receiving dialysis.

1139
02:08:26,083 --> 02:08:28,415
The others have come and gone.

1140
02:08:28,749 --> 02:08:32,123
Jonas Sandberg is probably the
only one being social.

1141
02:08:32,458 --> 02:08:38,040
10:30, he met with two
people at a pizzeria in Bredäng.

1142
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:43,748
- Who did he meet?
- That's new faces to me.

1143
02:08:44,083 --> 02:08:47,123
- They look Eastern European...
- The Nikolic brothers

1144
02:08:47,458 --> 02:08:51,957
Tomi and Miro Nikolic. From Serbia,
but they've lived in Huddinge.

1145
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:55,582
Very unpleasant types.
Sharpshooters in the Civil War.

1146
02:08:55,916 --> 02:09:00,332
Miro's wanted for aggravated assault
but they live mostly in Serbia, so...

1147
02:09:00,666 --> 02:09:02,748
Mikael. Wait.

1148
02:09:12,166 --> 02:09:14,248
Hey, Samir.

1149
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:20,123
Sorry I'm late.

1150
02:09:23,083 --> 02:09:26,248
- How are you?
- How do you think?

1151
02:09:26,583 --> 02:09:29,623
- Why didn't you call me last night?
- What could you have done?

1152
02:09:29,958 --> 02:09:34,623
I called Milton Security
because I needed help.

1153
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:44,457
We have to look after our people, Micke.

1154
02:09:48,249 --> 02:09:51,665
Samir Gryta on Söder.
Connect me quickly, please.

1155
02:09:58,208 --> 02:10:03,248
I stopped the magazine.
I called the printer.

1156
02:10:05,499 --> 02:10:09,290
This also applies to Malin and Christer.
Their safety.

1157
02:10:09,624 --> 02:10:14,040
- Did you call the print shop?
- I won't take responsibility for this.

1158
02:10:14,374 --> 02:10:16,707
- It's too dangerous.
- Shit...

1159
02:10:17,041 --> 02:10:20,040
- Micke, telephone for you.
- No, not now.

1160
02:10:20,374 --> 02:10:22,707
It's very important.

1161
02:10:31,333 --> 02:10:33,082
Sorry.

1162
02:10:44,624 --> 02:10:46,707
- They're shooting!
- We'll take a shortcut.

1163
02:11:20,291 --> 02:11:21,707
Down!

1164
02:11:28,666 --> 02:11:32,165
Police! Police! Show your hands!

1165
02:11:37,291 --> 02:11:41,040
Police! Show your hands!

1166
02:11:44,666 --> 02:11:46,748
How is it?

1167
02:11:50,624 --> 02:11:52,873
Are you okay?

1168
02:11:54,874 --> 02:11:58,915
- Here, something to wipe your head.
- How are you?

1169
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:03,290
Get out with Blomkvist and Berger
as fast as hell.

1170
02:12:03,624 --> 02:12:06,498
We'll go out through the kitchen.
The kitchen!

1171
02:12:06,833 --> 02:12:10,790
Two police officers were
eating at the restaurant-

1172
02:12:11,124 --> 02:12:15,498
- And recognized the two brothers. One
was wanted for aggravated assault.

1173
02:12:15,833 --> 02:12:19,957
An exchange of fire broke out as they
were arrested, but no one was hurt.

1174
02:12:20,291 --> 02:12:24,207
The two brothers are now charged
with attempted murder.

1175
02:12:25,749 --> 02:12:28,290
That went well.

1176
02:12:28,624 --> 02:12:32,623
Shit!
Bad idea from the beginning.

1177
02:12:32,958 --> 02:12:36,998
No, but I didn't know
that one of them was wanted.

1178
02:12:37,333 --> 02:12:39,832
It's my fault.

1179
02:12:40,166 --> 02:12:45,873
- What will the Nikolic brothers tell?
- Not that they had a contract for the killing.

1180
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:49,123
They're not that fucking stupid.

1181
02:12:56,208 --> 02:12:59,915
I talked to Christer and Malin.

1182
02:13:00,916 --> 02:13:04,582
- They can't stay at the office now.
- No ...

1183
02:13:07,916 --> 02:13:11,165
I think about Dag and Mia.

1184
02:13:14,041 --> 02:13:16,748
We could've also died today.

1185
02:13:17,083 --> 02:13:19,165
Both of us.

1186
02:13:22,874 --> 02:13:27,123
There's no job that's
worth dying for.

1187
02:13:27,999 --> 02:13:30,290
No ...

1188
02:13:37,249 --> 02:13:42,665
We don't know if they just thought of
killing you, Mikael, or Erika as well.

1189
02:13:43,958 --> 02:13:48,873
But the idea was that the police
would find the drugs and money-

1190
02:13:49,208 --> 02:13:52,707
And link it with a
Yugoslavian drug deal.

1191
02:13:53,041 --> 02:13:58,165
- What of the other staff editors?
- We will close for a couple of days.

1192
02:13:58,499 --> 02:14:03,707
We'll postpone the release of
the magazine, also.

1193
02:14:05,249 --> 02:14:08,165
I suggest that you and Erika
have bodyguards.

1194
02:14:08,499 --> 02:14:12,457
No, I don't want somebody following me.

1195
02:14:53,958 --> 02:14:59,290
- Now we'll see how it goes.
- Have you had contact with her?

1196
02:15:00,458 --> 02:15:02,165
What happened?

1197
02:15:02,499 --> 02:15:05,790
I'll push for Lisbeth Salander to be
committed to the mental hospital-

1198
02:15:06,124 --> 02:15:09,165
- Failing that, a long prison sentence.

1199
02:15:09,499 --> 02:15:11,915
Usually that tends to be reversed.

1200
02:15:12,249 --> 02:15:14,790
Yes, but in this case-

1201
02:15:15,124 --> 02:15:18,915
- The psychiatric opinion is
so unequivocal-

1202
02:15:19,249 --> 02:15:21,957
- I don't have any alternative.

1203
02:15:22,291 --> 02:15:24,082
Thank you very much.

1204
02:15:25,208 --> 02:15:30,082
The trial of Lisbeth Salander begins
here in Stockholms' District Court-

1205
02:15:30,416 --> 02:15:33,540
- Today at 13, in about an hour.

1206
02:15:33,874 --> 02:15:39,998
It's expected to last three days
and has aroused great public interest.

1207
02:15:40,333 --> 02:15:43,998
Both the police and the prosecutor
have prepared their case-

1208
02:15:44,333 --> 02:15:48,332
- and given information to the media
while the defense has denied...

1209
02:15:48,666 --> 02:15:52,165
Holy shit.
Is it time?

1210
02:15:55,166 --> 02:15:58,290
- I didn't sleep one hour last night.
- It'll go well.

1211
02:15:58,624 --> 02:16:00,707
Yeah ...!

1212
02:16:04,749 --> 02:16:06,832
It will go well.

1213
02:16:08,041 --> 02:16:12,415
- So.
- Thanks. See you later. Bye.

1214
02:17:33,458 --> 02:17:36,082
Back, back!

1215
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:08,082
I can only regret-

1216
02:18:08,416 --> 02:18:12,873
- That Lisbeth Salander didn't say
a single word during seven hearings.

1217
02:18:13,208 --> 02:18:18,040
But the fact doesn't weaken
any of the charges against her.

1218
02:18:18,374 --> 02:18:20,082
Thanks.

1219
02:18:20,416 --> 02:18:24,415
So I leave the floor to the lawyer.

1220
02:18:24,749 --> 02:18:26,665
Thanks.

1221
02:18:27,749 --> 02:18:31,415
From the defense side,
we reject all counts.

1222
02:18:31,749 --> 02:18:35,832
We will prove that the
prosecutor's allegations are false-

1223
02:18:36,166 --> 02:18:40,040
- And that my client has been exposed
to serious gross legal violations.

1224
02:18:40,374 --> 02:18:43,790
I'll ask that my client
be declared innocent-

1225
02:18:44,124 --> 02:18:48,540
- That her guardianship be repealed
and that she be released immediately.

1226
02:18:49,666 --> 02:18:51,415
Thanks.

1227
02:18:51,749 --> 02:18:54,790
Does the prosecutor have anything to add?

1228
02:18:55,124 --> 02:19:01,957
I'd like to request that negotiations
be conducted behind closed doors.

1229
02:19:02,291 --> 02:19:06,665
It's about a vulnerable person, her
psychological health and wellbeing-

1230
02:19:06,999 --> 02:19:10,165
- As well as about material which
is marked confidential-

1231
02:19:10,499 --> 02:19:14,957
- And in some parts may pertain
to national security.

1232
02:19:21,249 --> 02:19:23,623
See you tonight.

1233
02:19:35,708 --> 02:19:38,373
Great.

1234
02:19:43,791 --> 02:19:48,915
So we shall begin by
trying to get some clarity in-

1235
02:19:49,249 --> 02:19:52,332
- Why you went to Gosseberga-

1236
02:19:52,666 --> 02:19:56,748
- To try to kill your father
Alexander Zalachenko-

1237
02:19:57,083 --> 02:20:00,248
- Also known as Karl Axel Bodin.

1238
02:20:07,083 --> 02:20:10,957
Should we understand from your silence
that you don't want to answer questions?

1239
02:20:11,291 --> 02:20:14,207
I'll gladly answer questions.

1240
02:20:16,749 --> 02:20:19,457
Then maybe you can answer the question.

1241
02:20:19,791 --> 02:20:23,165
I haven't heard any questions yet.

1242
02:20:25,166 --> 02:20:29,373
I asked if you went to Gosseberga
with the intention to kill your father.

1243
02:20:29,708 --> 02:20:33,082
No, you said you wanted to
try to clarify-

1244
02:20:33,416 --> 02:20:37,540
- why I drove to Gosseberga to try to
kill my father, Alexander Zalachenko.

1245
02:20:37,874 --> 02:20:41,290
It was an allegation where you anticipated
a response, an unverified assertion.

1246
02:20:41,624 --> 02:20:45,082
- Answer the question.
- No.

1247
02:20:45,791 --> 02:20:49,957
- No, what?
- No is my answer to the question.

1248
02:20:57,291 --> 02:21:00,582
Did you bury an axe in the head of your father?

1249
02:21:00,916 --> 02:21:02,248
Yes.

1250
02:21:02,583 --> 02:21:07,623
He was seriously wounded, and I argue
that it is attempted murder.

1251
02:21:08,749 --> 02:21:10,373
What's your opinion?

1252
02:21:10,708 --> 02:21:14,582
That was two assertions.
Which should I state my opinion on?

1253
02:21:14,916 --> 02:21:18,790
If the axe blow to the head of
your father was attempted murder?

1254
02:21:19,124 --> 02:21:22,790
There was no attempted murder.
It was self-defense.

1255
02:21:34,958 --> 02:21:36,415
Thanks.

1256
02:21:36,749 --> 02:21:39,665
Let me know if you need anything.

1257
02:21:39,999 --> 02:21:43,832
- Can you get cigarettes?
- Forget it.

1258
02:21:55,083 --> 02:21:56,915
Thanks.

1259
02:22:08,124 --> 02:22:10,457
- Hi.
- Hi.

1260
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:25,165
- How does it feel to have bodyguards?
- It's okay...

1261
02:22:25,499 --> 02:22:28,623
As long as they stay outside.

1262
02:22:35,999 --> 02:22:38,165
Erika ...

1263
02:22:40,749 --> 02:22:43,332
I couldn't do it.

1264
02:22:50,999 --> 02:22:53,165
You are an egoist.

1265
02:22:53,499 --> 02:22:55,790
And stupid.

1266
02:23:02,916 --> 02:23:07,873
I'm staying home this week.
Next week also.

1267
02:23:08,208 --> 02:23:12,665
I have to be sure that I
make the right decision.

1268
02:23:12,999 --> 02:23:14,665
Yes.

1269
02:23:20,791 --> 02:23:24,207
Is it about us or Millennium?

1270
02:23:24,541 --> 02:23:26,998
Both.

1271
02:23:27,333 --> 02:23:30,207
I think.

1272
02:23:31,166 --> 02:23:34,082
I'll be in touch.

1273
02:23:39,041 --> 02:23:41,623
Take care.

1274
02:23:44,374 --> 02:23:45,873
Damn.

1275
02:23:59,624 --> 02:24:02,123
Salander, it's time.

1276
02:24:06,416 --> 02:24:10,582
Lisbeth Salanders'
so-called autobiography,

1277
02:24:10,916 --> 02:24:14,123
- Lacks any credibility.

1278
02:24:14,458 --> 02:24:18,498
It's a series of allegations
about various individuals-

1279
02:24:18,833 --> 02:24:21,957
- Each one more absurd than the other.

1280
02:24:22,291 --> 02:24:25,082
Overall, it's an expression of-

1281
02:24:25,416 --> 02:24:30,665
- The paranoid-schizophrenia that
Lisbeth Salander is suffering from.

1282
02:24:31,624 --> 02:24:33,540
Can you give an example?

1283
02:24:33,874 --> 02:24:40,123
The most obvious,
the depiction of the rape-

1284
02:24:40,458 --> 02:24:42,790
- She claims-

1285
02:24:43,124 --> 02:24:47,873
- Her guardian, lawyer
Bjurman, is guilty of.

1286
02:24:48,208 --> 02:24:53,123
The entire narrative
with all its details-

1287
02:24:53,458 --> 02:24:59,290
- Is a classic example
on the kind of grotesque fantasy-

1288
02:24:59,624 --> 02:25:03,290
- That children tend to exhibit.

1289
02:25:04,833 --> 02:25:08,790
Now, Lisbeth Salander is no child,
she's a grown woman.

1290
02:25:09,124 --> 02:25:11,415
That is correct. Although it remains
to be seen-

1291
02:25:11,749 --> 02:25:18,207
- exactly what her mental level
may be.

1292
02:25:19,249 --> 02:25:24,332
In principle you're right.
But she, like a child,-

1293
02:25:24,666 --> 02:25:29,082
- Is unable to distinguish fantasy
from Reality.

1294
02:25:35,041 --> 02:25:37,332
I understand.

1295
02:25:40,291 --> 02:25:46,123
In 1993, Lisbeth Salander was forcibly
hospitalized at St. Stephen's.

1296
02:25:47,166 --> 02:25:50,457
Over the years that she lived there,
you had responsibility for her.

1297
02:25:50,791 --> 02:25:53,540
Is that correct?
- Yes.

1298
02:25:54,874 --> 02:25:58,207
How many days was she
kept in restraints there?

1299
02:25:58,541 --> 02:26:01,040
I mean fastened in bed with straps.

1300
02:26:01,374 --> 02:26:05,207
That, I can't possibly remember.
But not many.

1301
02:26:05,958 --> 02:26:08,082
Approximately?

1302
02:26:09,208 --> 02:26:14,332
Possibly ... thirty. But I fail to
understand what relevance this has.

1303
02:26:14,666 --> 02:26:18,790
Lisbeth Salander herself, claims
it was 381 days in total.

1304
02:26:19,124 --> 02:26:22,957
That's pure fantasy.
Absurd.

1305
02:26:23,291 --> 02:26:26,665
She wasn't strapped down
with belts for more than a year...

1306
02:26:26,999 --> 02:26:30,415
- ... Of the two years she lived there?
- Of course not.

1307
02:26:31,374 --> 02:26:37,540
The defense repeatedly tried to get
Lisbeth Salander's medical records-

1308
02:26:37,874 --> 02:26:42,665
- From the years she was hospitalized
at St. Stephen's, but without success.

1309
02:26:42,999 --> 02:26:47,290
- Can you explain why?
- Yes, it's confidential.

1310
02:26:47,624 --> 02:26:51,790
- It always is in such
investigations, as a rule.

1311
02:26:52,124 --> 02:26:54,915
The lawyer should know.

1312
02:26:55,249 --> 02:27:00,082
I have a copy here of Lisbeth
Salander's records from the two years-

1313
02:27:00,416 --> 02:27:03,582
- 1993 and 1994.

1314
02:27:04,749 --> 02:27:10,498
Here it's clear that Lisbeth Salander
was restrained by straps for 381 days.

1315
02:27:10,833 --> 02:27:16,082
Attorney Giannini, how's this
revelant to the trial?

1316
02:27:16,416 --> 02:27:21,582
I want to demonstrate that Peter Teleborian
isn't telling the truth in this situation.

1317
02:27:21,916 --> 02:27:29,040
Attorney Giannini, the records of
'93 and '94 can't be used today-

1318
02:27:29,374 --> 02:27:34,582
- To question Peter Teleborians' credibility.

1319
02:28:24,166 --> 02:28:26,748
I felt like an idiot.

1320
02:28:28,499 --> 02:28:31,832
It wasn't wrong;
for Teleborian is a fucking liar.

1321
02:28:32,166 --> 02:28:34,540
This is proven in Björcks' investigation.

1322
02:28:34,874 --> 02:28:40,332
It proves what he did then,
not what he does now.

1323
02:28:40,666 --> 02:28:47,040
When the prosecutor submitted Teleborians'
new opinion, I did nothing.

1324
02:28:48,708 --> 02:28:53,623
She'll land in the madhouse again
and I can't do anything about it.

1325
02:30:17,541 --> 02:30:19,165
Who are you?

1326
02:30:19,499 --> 02:30:21,540
Plague.

1327
02:30:23,999 --> 02:30:26,123
What is this?

1328
02:30:26,458 --> 02:30:30,748
Peter Teleborians private computer.
Copied on a USB key.

1329
02:30:33,208 --> 02:30:36,040
Sorry. Come in.

1330
02:30:39,208 --> 02:30:41,582
What's it contain?

1331
02:30:41,916 --> 02:30:44,457
Everything you need.

1332
02:30:46,749 --> 02:30:50,082
Plus some nasty shit.

1333
02:31:08,374 --> 02:31:13,748
Annika, I have everything you need here.
Cooperation with the Section.

1334
02:31:14,083 --> 02:31:18,248
Several versions of the psychiatric report, falsified dates-

1335
02:31:18,583 --> 02:31:22,373
- eMail correspondence, everything.

1336
02:31:22,708 --> 02:31:25,207
- There you are. Yes, it was good.

1337
02:31:25,541 --> 02:31:29,040
- Here.
- The reports I never saw.

1338
02:31:29,374 --> 02:31:33,123
Read it over lunch.
The dates are important.

1339
02:31:33,458 --> 02:31:38,332
Great, great.
See you later. Bye Bye.

1340
02:31:42,416 --> 02:31:44,707
You ended up at St. Stephen's

1341
02:31:45,041 --> 02:31:48,290
- After having poured petrol over
your dad and then lighting the fire.

1342
02:31:48,624 --> 02:31:51,623
- Yes.
- Why did you do it?

1343
02:31:54,249 --> 02:31:57,540
Because he beat up my mother
for several years.

1344
02:31:57,874 --> 02:32:02,207
On the 12th of June, 1993, he assaulted her
so brutally that she was handicapped.

1345
02:32:02,541 --> 02:32:07,457
- She received permanent brain damage.
- Did you tell that to anyone?

1346
02:32:08,333 --> 02:32:11,623
- Yes, the police officers
who interrogated me-

1347
02:32:11,958 --> 02:32:17,123
- To the social worker, different doctors,
a priest, and that pig.

1348
02:32:19,999 --> 02:32:23,457
Why do you call Peter
Teleborian a pig?

1349
02:32:26,708 --> 02:32:31,082
When I came to St. Stephen's
I tried to explain what had happened.-

1350
02:32:31,416 --> 02:32:35,373
- But he claimed that I fantasized.
As punishment, I was put in straps.

1351
02:32:35,708 --> 02:32:40,040
That's pure nonsense.
Again an exemple-

1352
02:32:40,374 --> 02:32:44,540
- That your client has no ability
to differentiate fantasy from reality.

1353
02:32:44,874 --> 02:32:50,957
- You lie, you fucking pig.
- Here we speak appropriately in the court.

1354
02:32:52,749 --> 02:32:57,207
Now I would like to move on
with the sexual abuse-

1355
02:32:57,541 --> 02:33:01,873
- As a lawyer, Nils Bjurman
exploited my client.

1356
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:04,873
That's not the case.

1357
02:33:05,208 --> 02:33:09,623
These are absurd allegations,
without a shred of evidence.

1358
02:33:09,958 --> 02:33:15,915
It's an example of the legal
abuse Lisbeth suffered.

1359
02:33:16,249 --> 02:33:19,998
When it comes to Frederick Clinton
he may be on dialysis.-

1360
02:33:20,333 --> 02:33:23,248
- In the care of
Karolinska Hospital.

1361
02:33:23,583 --> 02:33:28,207
Everyone here will get all the files
with all the necessary information.

1362
02:33:28,541 --> 02:33:32,415
I repeat.
Group 1: Bublanski.

1363
02:33:32,749 --> 02:33:34,748
Group 2: Svensson.

1364
02:33:35,083 --> 02:33:36,998
Group 3: Modig.

1365
02:33:37,333 --> 02:33:39,498
Group 4: Figuerola.

1366
02:33:39,833 --> 02:33:42,498
Group 5: Holmberg.

1367
02:33:42,833 --> 02:33:48,498
For questions or queries speak to
your respective chief operating officer.

1368
02:33:50,208 --> 02:33:51,832
Good luck.

1369
02:33:57,583 --> 02:34:00,998
We're here at the ongoing trial
of Lisbeth Salander-

1370
02:34:01,333 --> 02:34:07,373
- Who, according to Millennium was
subjected to a series of legal assaults-

1371
02:34:07,708 --> 02:34:12,415
- Orchestrated by a secret organization
known as "The Section".

1372
02:34:12,749 --> 02:34:16,415
This is the third day of the trial.

1373
02:34:17,416 --> 02:34:22,540
- You maintain that Bjurman raped you?
- Yes.

1374
02:34:22,874 --> 02:34:26,332
- When, in that case, would it have happened?
- Not "in this case"

1375
02:34:26,666 --> 02:34:29,582
It was Tuesday the 18th of February, 2008 -

1376
02:34:29,916 --> 02:34:34,582
And Friday the 7th of March, same year.
It's clear in my biography.

1377
02:34:34,916 --> 02:34:37,832
- Did you notify the police?
- No.

1378
02:34:38,166 --> 02:34:42,623
- Why not?
- The police have never listened to me.

1379
02:34:45,958 --> 02:34:49,540
- Did you seek medical attention for your injuries?

1380
02:34:49,874 --> 02:34:51,957
No.

1381
02:34:53,124 --> 02:34:56,540
- Did you talk to somebody about it?
- No.

1382
02:35:02,124 --> 02:35:06,665
The late lawyer, Nils Bjurman, has never
been convicted of any criminal offense.

1383
02:35:06,999 --> 02:35:12,082
He's never been reported or been
under investigation for anything.

1384
02:35:13,999 --> 02:35:18,332
However, it's my duty
to point out that Lisbeth Salander-

1385
02:35:18,666 --> 02:35:22,582
- Is diagnosed
as paranoid schizophrenic.

1386
02:35:24,166 --> 02:35:27,040
She has spent several years
at a child psychiatric clinic-

1387
02:35:27,374 --> 02:35:31,290
- And has been under guardianship
since she was eighteen years old.

1388
02:35:31,624 --> 02:35:36,790
How regrettable it is, that-

1389
02:35:38,583 --> 02:35:45,332
- Lisbeth Salander has a totally
confused view of the world.

1390
02:35:46,249 --> 02:35:51,957
It appears with abundant
clarity in this "autobiography".

1391
02:35:52,291 --> 02:35:56,748
Nowhere else does the rupture
of her sense of realism appear so clearly.

1392
02:35:57,083 --> 02:35:58,832
In light of the lack of evidence-

1393
02:35:59,166 --> 02:36:04,832
- We will try to evaluate the credibility
of her claims in her words and statements.

1394
02:36:07,374 --> 02:36:10,998
- Is the prosecutor finished?
- Yes.

1395
02:36:11,333 --> 02:36:15,873
- Then the lawyer can present evidence.

1396
02:36:18,833 --> 02:36:24,373
Peter Teleborian claims
that Lisbeth Salander is lying-

1397
02:36:24,708 --> 02:36:29,873
- On the allegations that she was
sexually exploited by lawyer Bjurman.

1398
02:36:30,916 --> 02:36:34,582
The Prosecutor is of the same opinion.

1399
02:36:35,749 --> 02:36:42,123
- I shall now demonstrate what
Lisbeth claims is completely true.

1400
02:36:43,458 --> 02:36:46,165
- When was this filmed, Lisbeth?

1401
02:36:46,499 --> 02:36:50,498
On the 7th of March, 2008.
I used a hidden camera.

1402
02:37:03,708 --> 02:37:05,832
If you're good...

1403
02:37:06,166 --> 02:37:08,623
If you ...

1404
02:37:08,958 --> 02:37:11,998
If you're good...

1405
02:37:17,583 --> 02:37:19,873
I'll be good to you.

1406
02:37:21,749 --> 02:37:23,873
Are you good?

1407
02:37:24,208 --> 02:37:27,290
Are you good? Are you good?

1408
02:37:30,708 --> 02:37:32,957
It's too late.

1409
02:37:43,374 --> 02:37:45,290
Stop the film!

1410
02:37:45,624 --> 02:37:47,665
Enough!

1411
02:37:57,999 --> 02:38:01,790
- Why did you record it?
- Bjurman had raped me before.

1412
02:38:02,124 --> 02:38:04,165
- He'd forced me to perform oral sex.

1413
02:38:04,499 --> 02:38:08,123
He demanded more if I wanted to
get access to my money.

1414
02:38:08,458 --> 02:38:11,540
It was the only way
to obtain evidence against him.

1415
02:38:11,874 --> 02:38:15,790
The only way to get him to stop.

1416
02:38:16,833 --> 02:38:20,790
We'll take a break.
We need 20 minutes.

1417
02:38:23,041 --> 02:38:27,832
Can we take an hour?
We need to collect ourselves after this.

1418
02:38:28,166 --> 02:38:31,498
Then it'll be a one hour break.

1419
02:39:16,166 --> 02:39:20,290
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. Thank you.

1420
02:39:22,833 --> 02:39:25,915
You're submitting new material?

1421
02:39:26,249 --> 02:39:31,415
It's the same the Court already has,
but with small, crucial differences.

1422
02:39:31,749 --> 02:39:34,082
I'll get to it.

1423
02:39:34,416 --> 02:39:38,207
- Then I give the floor to the lawyer.
- Thank you.

1424
02:39:40,708 --> 02:39:42,498
Yes ...

1425
02:39:44,124 --> 02:39:46,873
No one can deny that Lisbeth
was subjected to-

1426
02:39:47,208 --> 02:39:52,957
- serious sexual abuse by her
guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman.

1427
02:39:53,291 --> 02:39:56,832
A person she thought
she could trust.

1428
02:39:58,458 --> 02:40:04,332
As I've said, this illustrates the
type of prolonged assaults against Lisbeth.

1429
02:40:05,541 --> 02:40:10,123
The attacks have both been
psychological and legal.

1430
02:40:11,541 --> 02:40:17,540
The person who has a major responsibility
for this is Dr. Peter Teleborian.

1431
02:40:18,749 --> 02:40:22,957
He was, in 1993, together
with Gunnar Björck-

1432
02:40:23,291 --> 02:40:28,082
- a member of an illegal
group within the Security Police-

1433
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:31,832
- And he wrote a forensic
psychiatric report-

1434
02:40:32,166 --> 02:40:37,165
- With the intent to imprison
a dangerous witness-

1435
02:40:37,499 --> 02:40:43,582
- Thus, Lisbeth Salander, was transferred
to a secure psychiatric clinic.

1436
02:40:43,916 --> 02:40:47,707
There must be some moderation
on these accusations ...

1437
02:40:48,041 --> 02:40:50,623
Excuse me, but I was speaking.

1438
02:40:51,666 --> 02:40:55,123
This occurred after Lisbeth had poured
gasoline on her father-

1439
02:40:55,458 --> 02:41:00,873
- Alexander Zalachenko, in a
desperate attempt to save the mother.

1440
02:41:02,041 --> 02:41:04,998
But those who protected Zalachenko-

1441
02:41:05,333 --> 02:41:09,873
- Made sure to put a lid on it
and classified the matter.

1442
02:41:10,208 --> 02:41:14,582
- Instead, with Peter Teleborians' help-

1443
02:41:14,916 --> 02:41:19,040
- Lisbeth was locked away
at St Stephen's in Uppsala.

1444
02:41:19,374 --> 02:41:22,332
It's a crazy accusation!

1445
02:41:22,666 --> 02:41:27,915
- I've tried to help Lisbeth
Salander in the best way. She tried...

1446
02:41:28,249 --> 02:41:33,665
- Yesterday, Peter Teleborian presented
his new legal psychiatric opinion here.

1447
02:41:33,999 --> 02:41:35,957
Once again, it proposes-

1448
02:41:36,291 --> 02:41:40,748
- The compulsory detention of Lisbeth
Salander and locking her up.

1449
02:41:41,291 --> 02:41:44,540
But just like in 1993,
it's under false pretenses.

1450
02:41:44,874 --> 02:41:46,457
That is quite...

1451
02:41:46,791 --> 02:41:51,498
I must ask you to allow the lawyer to
finish speaking. Thank you.

1452
02:41:56,041 --> 02:41:57,998
Thanks.

1453
02:42:01,666 --> 02:42:06,873
The statement is based on
"observations" of my client.

1454
02:42:09,624 --> 02:42:13,998
These must have been from the time
She was moved to Kronoberg-

1455
02:42:14,333 --> 02:42:19,373
- on October 6, and must have been
completed by November 5.

1456
02:42:20,333 --> 02:42:23,415
Is that correct, Peter Teleborian?

1457
02:42:26,833 --> 02:42:31,332
Yes. I ask the court
to remember these dates.

1458
02:42:31,666 --> 02:42:37,832
You asked for permission to visit my
client in the hospital, but it was denied.

1459
02:42:38,333 --> 02:42:41,248
Is it true?

1460
02:42:45,958 --> 02:42:48,373
I wish to call two witnesses.

1461
02:42:55,208 --> 02:42:57,498
No!

1462
02:43:06,833 --> 02:43:09,998
Police, drop the gun!

1463
02:43:12,083 --> 02:43:14,165
Lie still!

1464
02:43:18,791 --> 02:43:22,582
Yes ... Do you recognize this document?

1465
02:43:27,624 --> 02:43:29,623
Yes.

1466
02:43:31,083 --> 02:43:36,873
It's the psychiatric report on
Lisbeth Salander, by Peter Teleborian.

1467
02:43:38,416 --> 02:43:41,207
There are currently three versions.

1468
02:43:41,541 --> 02:43:46,165
The first, dated September 20th;
the second on October 1st.

1469
02:43:46,499 --> 02:43:50,665
And this is the third,
which is dated October 6th.

1470
02:43:51,666 --> 02:43:54,415
You gave me the documents.

1471
02:43:54,749 --> 02:43:59,415
And I've noticed that the first
statement from October

1472
02:43:59,749 --> 02:44:05,957
- Is identical to the statement
Peter Teleborian preferred yesterday.

1473
02:44:06,291 --> 02:44:08,915
Dated November 5th.

1474
02:44:09,249 --> 02:44:11,998
That is, to say the least, remarkable.

1475
02:44:12,999 --> 02:44:17,248
My conclusion is that Peter Teleborian
wrote his report and diagnosis-

1476
02:44:17,583 --> 02:44:20,832
- Before he met with Lisbeth Salander.

1477
02:44:22,083 --> 02:44:25,623
Thus, it lacks all credibility.

1478
02:44:28,958 --> 02:44:31,748
Inspector Edklinth, is it correct-

1479
02:44:32,083 --> 02:44:36,873
- That you had these statements about
Salander given to you by Mikael Blomkvist?

1480
02:44:37,208 --> 02:44:38,498
Yes.

1481
02:44:38,833 --> 02:44:43,373
- What's your conclusion?
- That they're false.

1482
02:44:44,208 --> 02:44:46,873
They were written long before-

1483
02:44:47,208 --> 02:44:52,790
- Peter Teleborian had the opportunity to
meet Lisbeth Salander in custody.

1484
02:44:53,124 --> 02:44:58,040
They where forged in collaboration
with a certain Jonas Sandberg.

1485
02:44:58,374 --> 02:45:00,498
That's a lie.

1486
02:45:01,541 --> 02:45:04,415
- Is it a lie?
- No, not at all.

1487
02:45:04,749 --> 02:45:08,332
The documents are dated
and there's email correspondence-

1488
02:45:08,666 --> 02:45:13,248
- Between Peter Teleborian and
Jonas Sandberg proving this.

1489
02:45:13,583 --> 02:45:19,540
He's part of an illegal group within
the Security Police since the 1970s-

1490
02:45:19,874 --> 02:45:22,790
- Which protected
Alexander Zalachenko.

1491
02:45:23,124 --> 02:45:25,998
The group was behind the decision-

1492
02:45:26,333 --> 02:45:31,457
- To incarcerate Lisbeth Salander
at St. Stephen's Hospital in 1993.

1493
02:45:33,249 --> 02:45:36,248
Jonas Sandberg is
one of a dozen or so-

1494
02:45:36,583 --> 02:45:39,873
- Who where arrested today.

1495
02:45:40,208 --> 02:45:44,582
He's suspected of involvement in
the murder of Gunnar Björck.

1496
02:45:44,916 --> 02:45:50,790
Possibly another murder.
We have evidence and multiple confessions.

1497
02:45:59,499 --> 02:46:03,082
Would Peter Teleborian care to
comment on this?

1498
02:46:13,583 --> 02:46:16,707
Two police officers are waiting
outside the courtroom.

1499
02:46:17,041 --> 02:46:21,748
They're to take Peter Teleborian
with them for questioning.

1500
02:46:22,083 --> 02:46:23,582
Why?

1501
02:46:23,916 --> 02:46:29,915
He's under arrest on suspicion of violating
the law on serious child pornography charges.

1502
02:46:30,249 --> 02:46:36,665
Specifically, for the possession of 8,000
child pornography images and movies-

1503
02:46:36,999 --> 02:46:39,998
- Found on his computer.

1504
02:46:55,249 --> 02:46:57,957
This has been seized.

1505
02:46:59,249 --> 02:47:02,040
Please come with me?

1506
02:47:36,708 --> 02:47:39,498
Please be seated.

1507
02:47:43,541 --> 02:47:48,790
The court was unable to assess
all the new information from the last hour-

1508
02:47:49,124 --> 02:47:55,248
- But finds no reason to keep
Lisbeth Salander in custody.

1509
02:47:56,166 --> 02:47:59,415
So you're free pending
the court's verdic.

1510
02:48:04,041 --> 02:48:05,623
Yes ...

1511
02:48:11,999 --> 02:48:16,457
That's right, I have keys
from Micke to give to you.

1512
02:48:24,083 --> 02:48:27,415
Are you sure you don't want
to join Millennium?

1513
02:48:27,749 --> 02:48:31,248
You can drop me off
at Folkungatan.

1514
02:48:34,916 --> 02:48:38,582
You know that this is all
thanks to Micke, right?

1515
02:48:40,124 --> 02:48:42,498
Yes. But ...

1516
02:48:44,083 --> 02:48:45,957
Yes.

1517
02:48:56,208 --> 02:48:59,415
I don't know where you live?

1518
02:49:00,166 --> 02:49:03,373
No, not now. Maybe later.

1519
02:49:11,499 --> 02:49:14,082
What will you do now?

1520
02:49:20,166 --> 02:49:24,582
- I must be able to reach you.
- You can contact me by email.

1521
02:49:25,833 --> 02:49:27,915
Good.

1522
02:49:51,874 --> 02:49:53,582
Bye.

1523
02:50:36,624 --> 02:50:40,332
- Why did it finish like this?
- Justice prevailed.

1524
02:50:40,666 --> 02:50:43,998
- So now there's a party?
- Now there's a party.

1525
02:50:44,333 --> 02:50:47,790
- What's going to happen now?
- Now it begins!

1526
02:50:48,124 --> 02:50:50,915
suspected of murder, among other things.

1527
02:50:51,249 --> 02:50:55,457
The organization operated
from this building in Stockholm-

1528
02:50:55,791 --> 02:50:59,998
- and is responsible for serious gross
abuses against Lisbeth Salander.

1529
02:51:00,333 --> 02:51:02,915
But the story begins in the 60s.

1530
02:51:03,249 --> 02:51:08,623
When "The Section" was created to
guard and monitor the nation's interests.

1531
02:51:08,958 --> 02:51:15,457
Officially, they never existed.

1532
02:51:15,791 --> 02:51:21,165
Evidence suggests that not even
the State Police knew about the group.

1533
02:51:21,499 --> 02:51:28,082
In the mid-70s "The Section" recruited
a top Soviet spy ...

1534
02:51:28,416 --> 02:51:31,832
Lisbeth is released
pending the verdict.

1535
02:51:32,166 --> 02:51:36,623
Then she'll either be acquitted
or get probation.

1536
02:52:43,249 --> 02:52:46,457
- Here.
- What's this?

1537
02:52:46,791 --> 02:52:49,082
It's the legacy of Zalachenko.

1538
02:52:49,416 --> 02:52:52,748
I don't want anything
from that pig.

1539
02:52:54,499 --> 02:52:57,415
No, but you are of legal age now.

1540
02:52:57,749 --> 02:53:02,332
So I need your signature
that you've received this.

1541
02:53:05,583 --> 02:53:07,957
There are securities totalling 300,000 -

1542
02:53:08,291 --> 02:53:11,748
Plus a property in Gosseberga,
valued at 1.5 million.

1543
02:53:12,083 --> 02:53:15,415
I don't want anything to do with it.

1544
02:53:16,624 --> 02:53:19,040
Then there is this ...

1545
02:53:19,958 --> 02:53:23,165
A derelict brickworks at a
place outside Norrtälje.

1546
02:53:23,499 --> 02:53:27,082
Just the plot is valued at 150,000.

1547
02:53:27,874 --> 02:53:29,707
All right.

1548
02:53:30,041 --> 02:53:33,373
Sell the dump and give the money to
charity.

1549
02:53:37,708 --> 02:53:40,623
I think you need to read it through.

1550
02:53:40,958 --> 02:53:44,290
Then I can sell it for you.

1551
02:53:54,333 --> 02:53:56,873
Micke says hello.

1552
02:54:14,249 --> 02:54:18,915
- Pizza Bussola? There you go.
- Thanks. Bye.

1553
02:59:41,458 --> 02:59:43,498
Damn!

1554
03:00:52,083 --> 03:00:55,873
You deserve to die,
you fucking freak.

1555
03:01:13,999 --> 03:01:16,540
- 118118
- Yes, hello.

1556
03:01:16,874 --> 03:01:21,248
Give me the number for the
motorcycle club in Svavelsjö.

1557
03:01:29,791 --> 03:01:33,832
- Who is this?
- Are you interested in Niedermann?

1558
03:01:34,166 --> 03:01:36,040
I'm listening.

1559
03:01:59,166 --> 03:02:00,707
SOS Alarm.

1560
03:02:01,041 --> 03:02:05,748
Police killer Ronald Niedermann is
at Skederyds brickyard at Norrtälje.

1561
03:02:06,083 --> 03:02:10,707
A biker gang went to kill him.
They're heavily armed.

1562
03:03:07,666 --> 03:03:10,373
- Am I disturbing you?

1563
03:03:11,249 --> 03:03:15,040
- I was in the bath.
- Yes, I see...

1564
03:03:16,458 --> 03:03:19,165
- Have you seen the news?
- No.

1565
03:03:19,791 --> 03:03:25,582
Ronald Niedermann is dead. A gang
from Svavelsjö MC killed him.

1566
03:03:25,916 --> 03:03:31,873
Your old friend was shot by Sonny.
Now the police have him.

1567
03:03:55,666 --> 03:03:58,040
Thank you for everything.

1568
03:04:00,166 --> 03:04:02,040
Thanks.

1569
03:04:05,958 --> 03:04:08,040
Thank you.

1570
03:04:14,958 --> 03:04:17,207
See ya.

1571
03:04:19,499 --> 03:04:22,665
- We'll talk.
- Absolutely.
